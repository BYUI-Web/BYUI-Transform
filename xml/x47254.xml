When Pat was five years old, she moved onto the same block as Howard. When you ask them how they met, they reply, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. He (or she) was always there!&rdquo; Howard will also tell you he wasn&rsquo;t a very good finder, so the Lord put Pat literally in his back yard. Howard served in the Ohio/West Virginia mission from 1972 &ndash; 1974, and they were married the next year in the Salt Lake temple. They both graduated from Brigham Young University in April of 1977, their first child was born in May and Howard began his career with Continental Oil Company in June of that same year. This took them to the mid-west where they spent 32 years in Oklahoma and three years in Texas.<br /><br />Howard retired in May 2012 with 35 years of experience as a manufacturing and engineering manager in the Refining and Petrochemicals Industry working for Conoco, DuPont and ConocoPhillips. This all began with a BS degree in Chemical Engineering and later, a Master&rsquo;s degree in Business Administration. Howard is a Registered Professional Engineer in the state of Oklahoma. During his career, he served in many church callings. He was bishop twice&mdash;once in Ponca City, Oklahoma and once in Houston, Texas. He has been a high councilor, Young Men&rsquo;s President (three times), Scout Master and Venture Coach, High Priests Group Leader, and taught various adult and youth Sunday School Classes including Early Morning Seminary. He also served as a counselor to three bishops and as an ordinance worker in the Houston Temple.<br /><br />Howard and Pat were both active in the community as their six children were growing up. They served on various boards and committees within the school and city government system as well as provided volunteer coaching for basketball, baseball, and soccer. Their three girls and three boys were, and still are, their greatest joy. So far, they have given them twelve beautiful and perfect grandchildren!<br /><br />Pat put her BS degree in Family Studies to good use as a full-time wife and mother. In the Church, she served in all the auxiliary organizations either as a teacher, counselor, or president. As an accompanist, she filled various musical callings as well. With her husband, she served as an ordinance worker in the Houston temple. She particularly loved being the Primary chorister, Stake Girls Camp Director, and a Family History Consultant, but 13 years as an Early Morning Seminary Teacher has been her most favorite calling by far!<br /><br />We are excited for this opportunity to serve our first mission at BYU-I and are looking forward to working with the students, administrators, and career service missionaries in the intern program.</div>
