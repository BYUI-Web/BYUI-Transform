<p><em>Women of Righteousness, Elder M. Russell Ballard</em></p>
<p><em>"The premortal and mortal natures of men and women were specified by God Himself. ... [Sometimes women] ask: 'Is a woman's value dependent exclusively upon her role as a wife and mother?'

<p><em>Things as they Really Are, President David A. Bednar</em></p>
<p><em>In this dispensation the Lord revealed that "the spirit and the body are the soul of man" (<a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.15?lang=eng#14">D&amp;C 88:15</a>).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose:</span></strong></em></p>
<p><em>Always in the Middle, President David A. Bednar</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, there will be moments of beginnings and moments of endings throughout our lives, but these are only markers along the way of the great middle of our eternal lives. Whether we are at the beginning or the end, whether we are young or old, the Lord can use us for His purposes if we simply set aside whatever thoughts limit our ability to serve and allow His will to shape our lives.</em></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>IN THE PREMORTAL REALM, spirit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sons and daughters</span> knew and worshipped God as their Eternal Father and accepted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">His plan</span> by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">divine destiny</span> as heirs of eternal life. The divine plan of happiness <span style="text-decoration: underline;">enables family</span> relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">return </span>to the presence of God and for families to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">united eternally</span>.</strong></p>
<p><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sons and daughters</span></strong><strong>:</strong> "Parents ponder their responsibility to teach, to inspire, and to provide guidance, direction, and example. And while parents ponder, children-and particularly youth-ask the penetrating question, why are we here? Usually it is spoken silently to the soul and phrased, why am I here? How grateful we should be that a wise Creator fashioned an earth and placed us here, with a veil of forgetfulness of our previous existence so that we might experience a time of testing, an opportunity to prove ourselves in order to qualify for all that God has prepared for us to receive."</em></p>

We are eternal beings, spirit children of an eternal God. Our lives can be compared to a three-act play: premortal life (before we came to earth), mortal life (our time here on earth), and postmortal life (where we go after we die). God has had a plan for our lives since the beginning of the first act-a plan that, if followed, provides comfort and guidance now, as well as salvation and eternal happiness in our postmortal life."</em></p>

<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of creation-or may we say procreation-is not just an incidental part of the plan," says President Boyd K.

<p>Immorality cannot be made right by making it popular, President Packer continues. "The Lord's standard of morality commands that the sacred powers to beget life be protected and employed only between man and woman, husband and wife. To misuse this power is exceeded in seriousness only by the shedding of innocent blood and denying the Holy Ghost. <a href="http://www.lds.org/ensign/1972/07/why-stay-morally-clean?lang=eng&amp;query=%22your+actual+happiness+is+at+stake">http://www.lds.org/ensign/1972/07/why-stay-morally-clean?lang=eng&amp;query="your+actual+happiness+is+at+stake</a>"</p>

<p><strong>WE DECLARE the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity of life and of its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">importance in God's eternal plan</span>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Importance in God's Eternal Plan:</strong> "The commandment to multiply and replenish the earth has never been rescinded.

They need a friendly smile. They need a warm expression of true love. ..."To you who are parents, I say, show love to your children. You know you love them, but make certain they know it as well. They are so precious. Let them know. Call upon our Heavenly Father for help as you care for their needs each day and as you deal with the challenges which inevitably come with parenthood. You need more than your own wisdom in rearing them."<a href="http://www.lds.org/liahona/2011/08/love-at-home-counsel-from-our-prophet?lang=eng&amp;query=husband+wife#footnote3-09688_000_003"><sup>3</sup></a><sup> </sup>Joy in the Journey" (Brigham Young University Women's Conference, May 2, 2008), President Thomas S.

<p><strong>THE FAMILY is ordained of God. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marriage between man and woman is essential</span> to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved</span> when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of</span> faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fathers are to</span> preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mothers are primarily responsible for</span> the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">equal partners</span>. Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extended families should lend support when needed</span>.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marriage between man and women is essential: </span></strong>Two of the vital pillars that sustain Father in Heaven's plan of happiness are marriage and the family. Their lofty significance is underscored by Satan's relentless efforts to splinter the family and to undermine the significance of temple ordinances, which bind the family together for eternity. The temple sealing has greater meaning as life unfolds. It will help you draw ever closer together and find greater joy and fulfillment in mortality.</em></p>

The woman does not walk ahead of the man; neither does the man walk ahead of the woman. They walk side by side as a son and daughter of God on an eternal journey. She is not your servant, your chattel, nor anything of the kind. How tragic and utterly disgusting a phenomenon is wife abuse. Any man in this Church who abuses his wife, who demeans her, who insults her, who exercises unrighteous dominion over her is unworthy to hold the priesthood. Though he may have been ordained, the heavens will withdraw, the Spirit of the Lord will be grieved, and it will be amen to the authority of the priesthood of that man. Any man who engages in this practice is unworthy to hold a temple recommend. I regret to say that I see too much of this ugly phenomenon. There are men who cuff their wives about, both verbally and physically. What a tragedy when a man demeans the mother of his children.</em></p>
