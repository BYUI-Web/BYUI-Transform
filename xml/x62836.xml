<h2><span style="color: #333333;"><br />Preview</span></h2>
<p>The Inspired Learning &amp; Teaching seminar focuses on the eternal principles of learning that will foster greater inspiration and knowledge as you seek to learn and teach in the Lord's way: <em>"And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith"</em> (D&amp;C 88:118). <br /><br /> This seminar will introduce you to the BYU-Idaho Learning Model as the vehicle we use to deepen our learning experiences and to gain greater inspiration as we learn from and teach one another. The principles of the Learning Model are as follows:<br /><br /> Learners and teachers at BYU-Idaho:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Exercise faith in Christ as a principle of action and power,</li>
<li>Understand that true teaching is done by and with the Holy Ghost,</li>
<li>Lay hold upon the word of God as found in the holy scriptures and in the words of the prophets,</li>
<li>Act for themselves and accept responsibility for learning and teaching,</li>
<li>Love, serve, and teach one another.</li>
</ol>
<p>We apply these eternal principles to the three process steps of: <em>Prepare</em>, <em>Teach One Another</em>, and <em>Prove/Ponder</em>.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Preparation Activity</span></h2>
<p>The preparation activity for this seminar is to read and ponder the following quotes and answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can faith in Christ lead to greater learning?</li>
<li>How can the Holy Ghost play a greater role in your studies and learning?</li>
<li>What can you do to accept greater responsibilities for your own learning?</li>
</ul>

<p>"It is [students'] faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His restored gospel and their obedience to His commandments that will put Him at the center of the school. Their faith will largely determine whether we learn here by study and also by faith. As we do, we will attain academic excellence. We will not attain academic excellence without that faith of yours as students and those that follow to learn by study and by faith."&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;">(Henry B. Eyring, "A Steady, Upward Course," BYU-Idaho Devotional, September 18, 2001)</span></p>

<p>"To learn by faith, students need opportunities to take action. Some of those opportunities will come ... in the classroom, where prepared students, exercising faith, step out beyond the light they already possess, to speak, to contribute, and to teach one another. ... It is in that moment that the Spirit teaches." <span style="font-size: small;">(Kim B. Clark, "Inaugural Response," BYU-Idaho, Oct. 11, 2005)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #7d775c; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 1px;"><em>Raise your personal bar for learning by study and by faith<br /></em></span></p>
<p>"Where you set your personal bar for learning by study and by faith will have a profound impact on your education and on the education of those around you. Here are two things you can do to raise your personal bar.</p>
<p>"First, always come to class prepared to be taught and to teach. Always do the assigned reading or the problems before class. Think about what you have done and be ready to explain what you have learned and what you think. Always pray before class that you will have the Holy Ghost with you to teach you and guide you and help you contribute.</p>
<p>"Second, be on time for class. Being chronically late to class is a sign of disrespect and selfishness. It disrupts the class and hurts other people. We are building a Zion university at BYU-Idaho, and being on time and being prepared are important. In Zion, people come prepared and they come on time. ...</p>
<p>"Brothers and sisters, please listen to the Spirit and, under the Lord's direction, prayerfully raise your personal bar for learning by study and by faith. You will help to build Zion, and you will take important steps on the path of discipleship."&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;">(Kim B. Clark, "God Hath Prepared A More Excellent Way," BYU-Idaho Devotional, September 5, 2006)</span></p>
