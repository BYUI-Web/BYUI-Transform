<p>
<p>Larry Thompson taught English at Ricks/BYU-Idaho for 36 years, from 1968 to 2004. When asked about his academic achievement, Larry said, &ldquo;The thrust of my academic life is about a passion to learn, to be an eternal learner, and to manage with a very ordinary mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry says he nearly flunked out of high school his senior year before entering Palomar Junior College, in California. There, he says, he &ldquo;stumbled, got [his] sea legs, and ended up falling in love with learning.&rdquo; From there he went to BYU and &ldquo;had some good academic moments &hellip; and some very mediocre ones.&rdquo; He says at that time he didn&rsquo;t know &ldquo;how to study thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of his junior year, he went on a 2 &frac12; year mission to Germany. Larry says, &ldquo;That changed my life. I learned how to memorize hundreds of words and master German grammar. And I loved it.&rdquo; Larry returned and graduated in 1965 from BYU. He remained there for an MA degree, which he got in1967.</p>
<p>Then he attended the University of Oregon, where he &ldquo;worked [his] guts out, held on for dear life, and finished [his] course work.&rdquo; He graduated with a PhD in 1973. Of the experience, Larry said, &ldquo;It was as if the Lord said, &lsquo;If you really want this, we can make it happen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the process of working on his PhD, Larry &ldquo;promised the Lord [that he] would go on being an eternal learner.&rdquo; In late 2009, five years after his retirement, Larry said, &ldquo;And I will be. I am in two study groups and have reread Shakespeare's entire works, and much of Milton, Melville, Thoreau, and Hawthorne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry also said, &ldquo;I love the smell of printer's ink, the texture of paper, the endless meanings of words and how they change both the head and the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One BYU-I faculty member shared this recollection of working with Larry:</p>
<blockquote>Often I would encounter Larry in the hallway, and he would ask, &ldquo;What are you reading?&rdquo; I would tell him, and then ask him the same question. He was always reading something new, was always learning and encountering the world afresh.</blockquote>
<p>That same professor had this concluding remark about Larry Thompson:</p>
<blockquote>Larry was a man of wisdom and restraint. A man of few words, but all of those words worth listening to. Larry is a living example that faith and learning can be combined within the same soul without the loss of testimony in the gospel, and without a compromise to the standards of real academics.</blockquote>
