<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;">The following Accounting Forms are used for the processing and posting of transactions. The deadlines relating to these forms must be met by all account custodians on campus in order to (1) meet payment deadlines, (2) receive goods and services when needed, and (3) to have current financial data on the financial reports.</p>
<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Procedures</h4>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;">Employees should be acquainted with the policy for the use of each of the following forms before using them. Please refer to the Policies first.</p>
<ol style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; padding-left: 15px;">
<li><strong style="display: inline;">Budget Request</strong> and supporting forms are sent to departments by the Budget Office just prior to the budget preparation period for the coming year. These are to be completed and returned to the Budget Office. The deadlines will be included in the packet.</li>
<li><strong style="display: inline;">Request for Budget Adjustments</strong> forms are used during the year to request the transfer of budget amounts between categories within an account and between different accounts. After completing the form, the requester should send them to the Budget Office before the last day of the month in order for it to appear on the reports for that month.</li>
<li><strong style="display: inline;">Capital Equipment Changes</strong> used during the year to request that funds approved for one type of equipment be used for another type of equipment (replacement).</li>
<li><strong style="display: inline;">Campus Purchase Orders (CPOs)</strong> are used only for transactions between campus departments and accounts. Completed CPOs should be turned into the Accounting Office as soon as processed by the selling department except where the data is entered directly into the accounting system by the selling department. To have transactions posted to the current month, the CPOs should be in the Accounting Office by noon of the first working day of the following month.</li>
<li><strong style="display: inline;">Purchasing Requisitions/Purchase Orders</strong> are used for goods or services exceeding $2,500 which should be processed through the Purchasing Department. Purchase Requisitions, which create Purchase Orders, can only be done on the internet. Vendor invoices come directly to the Accounting Office for payment. If the items or invoices have not been received by the end of the month, the amount of the Purchase Order will appear on the financial statements of budgeted accounts as an encumbrance. It will not be on non-budgeted accounts.</li>
<li><strong style="display: inline;">Check Requests</strong> are used to request a check to be written which will be mailed by the Accounting Office. Appropriate supporting documentation must be attached to the requests. Check requests which are received by 5:00 pm will usually be processed the next morning and mailed by early afternoon. If a check must be mailed the next day, contact a payables clerk to make sure it is mailed on time. Checks are processed at 9:00 am each day. If an emergency occurs, contact the Disbursements Supervisor.</li>
<li><strong style="display: inline;">Vendor Invoices</strong> are used to process payment for items and services not on a Purchase Order or a Check Request. These invoices must have a valid account number written upon it along with a valid authorized signature. Invoices which are received by 5:00 pm will usually be processed the next morning and mailed by early afternoon.</li>
<li><strong style="display: inline;">Departmental Hand Checks</strong> may be used for purchases of $500 or less, although the use of a Purchase Card is preferred. These forms can be obtained directly from the Accounting Office as needed. Only individuals who are authorized to expend University funds from the account being charged can sign these checks. Unused checks must be kept in a secure location. Supporting documents must be attached to check copies unless the check is sent in the mail with an order which only requires appropriate explanation on the stub. As soon as a check is used, the yellow copy of the check along with supporting documents should be given to the supervisor of the person signing the check. The supervisor should sign the check for approval and forward the copy with attachments to the Accounting Office. Departmental check copies should be turned into the Accounting Office every Thursday at noon and on the first working day of each month.</li>

The form must be signed by the employee receiving the reimbursement and a person who is authorized to expend funds out of the account. Receipts must be attached. Petty Cash Custodians can replenish their petty cash by bringing the signed forms and receipts to the Cashiers Window.

<li><strong style="display: inline;">Vehicle Rental</strong> is found only on the internet. It is used to request a vehicle for one day travel. If a school vehicle is not available, a vehicle from a rental agency will be obtained. The availability of vehicles is the main factor in determining a deadline.</li>
