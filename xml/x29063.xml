<h2><a name="1"></a>What is Chemistry Education?</h2>
<p>The scientific study of matter, its properties, and interactions with other matter and with energy. It is science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances (elements and compounds), the reactions and transformations they undergo, and the energy released or absorbed during those processes. Often called the "central science," chemistry is concerned with atoms as building blocks (rather than with the subatomic domain) (http://www.uncw.edu/stuaff/career/Majors/chemistry.htm). As a chemistry education major, you would teach others things regarding the previously mentioned subject.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="2"></a>Why should I consider majoring in Chemistry Education?</h2>
<p>You might like this major if you like solving problems, lab experiments, taking things apart, working independently, using math, questioning why things are the way they are, and teaching others. You could consider this major if you are good at attention to detail, critical reading/thinking, math, quantitative analysis, research, teamwork, or if you have curiosity, initiative, perseverance, patience, and writing skills.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="3"></a>What will I learn from studying Chemistry Education?</h2>
<p>You would learn how to work with and teach students. You will also learn the necessary details pertaining to chemistry education. Subjects would consist of but not be limited to the periodic table, pharmaceuticals, study of matter and it's interactions with other matter and with energy, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="4"></a>What interests and values are related to Chemistry Education?</h2>
<p>Developing theories Science and math ability <br />Conduct research Perseverance<br />Attending to data Analytical skills <br />Curiosity Follow through skills<br />Utilizing formulas Perform experiments<br />Process data Observation and decision making <br />Work independently and in groups Technological skills <br />Oral and written communication Remain objective</p>
<p>Chemistry education majors should also develop skills involving planning and the ability to adapt teaching methods and modalities to the various learning styles of students</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="5"></a>What career fields are related to Chemistry Education?</h2>
<p>College Laboratory Technician<br />High School Science Teacher<br />College Science Professor</p>
