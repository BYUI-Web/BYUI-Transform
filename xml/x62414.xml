<p>The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs will currently allow students to seek back-payments for eligible classes not to exceed one year. The process can take up to 2-3 months. Students should plan on obtaining their first payment no sooner than the second month of each semester.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Award Levels</h4>
<p>VA benefits are determined on a semester to semester basis. The following criteria factor into determining a VA benefit amount:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolling in classes that fulfill graduation requirements (as contained on a BYU-Idaho degree audit)</li>
<li>Total number of enrolled credits for a semester. 10 eligible credits will currently satisfy the requirements for the full-time rate.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>Duration</h4>
<p>Eligible students receive 36 months of full time VA education benefits. This does not mean students are required to go to school full time. Students can receive Â½ time benefits over a period of 72 months, or Â¾ time over 48 months, etc.</p>
<p>If students are unsure how many months remain, call the VA (1-888-442-4551), and ask exactly how many months of full-time benefits the student has left. The VA can also explain the number of years a student has to use their benefits.</p>
<h5>Exceptions</h5>
<p><strong>Exception to the 36 month limit</strong> - Students with eligibility under more than one program â€“ can have a combined total of 48 months.</p>

Awards available to such students includes the Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty Chapter 30 and Post 9/11 Chapter 33 and the Reserve Educational Assistance Program Chapter 1607 (REAP).</p>
<h3 class="award_level">Chapter 30</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://gibill.va.gov/benefits/montgomery_gibill/active_duty.html" title="Link to Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD)" target="_blank"><strong>Montgomery GI Bill â€” Active Duty (MGIB-AD)</strong></a> states that active duty members forfeit $100 per month for 12 months; if they use the benefits, they receive as of 2009 $1321 monthly as a full time student (tiered at lower rates for less-than-full time) for a maximum of 36 months of education benefits.</p>
<p>This benefit may be used for degree and certificate programs, flight training, apprenticeship/on-the-job training and correspondence courses if the veteran is enrolled full-time. Part-time veteran students receive less, but for a proportionately longer period. Veterans from the reserve have different eligibility requirements and different rules on receiving benefits. MGIB may also be used while active, but as each service has additional educational benefit programs for active duty members most delay using MGIB benefits until after separation, discharge or retirement.</p>
