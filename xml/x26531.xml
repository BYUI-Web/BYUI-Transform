This includes all non-affiliated travelers and/or participants.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;">Student travel is considered to be "required" if the travel is necessary for the student to fulfill the requisites of a course or to participate in an official activity, and the trip is organized by the University and involves the supervision of University faculty or personnel. For example, a geology class traveling to Southern Utah as a group, with its instructor, to fulfill a class assignment is required travel. Typically, this type of travel is included in the course syllabus. <strong style="display: inline;">In this case, no waiver would be required.</strong> Conversely, if students were merely encouraged by the University to travel as a group in a private vehicle to attend a professional conference, such travel would not be considered to be required and <strong style="display: inline;">signed waivers would need to be collected by the appropriate department.</strong> This is true even if the University contributes to the expenses of the trip and/or a faculty member accompanies the student group. If a student chooses to take their personal vehicle rather use University-arranged transportation, a waiver would be required.&nbsp; This policy does not address circumstances where students travel on their own to fulfill class assignments or to conduct research since this travel is personal to the students.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;">The waiver should be customized for the trip by the trip manager, reviewed by Financial Services, signed by the participant, and kept by the department sponsoring the travel for two (2) years plus the current year. <strong style="display: inline;">If an incident occurs, the waivers should be sent, along with an incident report, to Financial Services at 290 Kimball immediately.</strong>Copies of anything regarding the incident should be retained by the sponsoring department for five (5) years.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.byui.edu/Documents/financial-services/ActivityWaiver.pdf">Assumption of Risk form </a></p>]]></BodyCopy><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="Policy" label="Policy" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="PolicyNavigationComponent" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="GroupStart" GroupStart="" Name="SEOGroup" label="SEO Group" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="true"><BrowserBarTitle type="string" label="Browser Bar Title" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false"></BrowserBarTitle><MetaDescription type="string" label="Meta Description" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false"></MetaDescription><NoFollow type="boolean" hidden="true" label="No Follow" readonly="false" required="false">false</NoFollow><NoIndex type="boolean" hidden="true" label="No Index" readonly="false" required="false">true</NoIndex><NoODP type="boolean" hidden="true" label="No ODP" readonly="false" required="false">false</NoODP><Priority type="enumeration" values="0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0" label="Priority" readonly="false" hidden="true" required="false">0.5</Priority></xPower><xPower Type="Navigation" StartPage="x5" MaxDepth="" MaxNodes="" GenerationOrder="down" Navigation="Ancestors" Query="" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="x18419" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="SiteControl" Expanded="false"/></PolicyPage>
