Miyasaki replaces Garth Hall, who is leaving to serve as a mission president for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p><br />"Garth Hall has done a magnificent job as vice president establishing and developing the area of Student Services and Activities," Brother Miyasaki said. "I love BYU-Idaho, the students and employees, and am humbled by this great opportunity to serve."</p>
<p><br />Kevin Miyasaki began his employment with BYU-Idaho in 1992 and is currently the dean of students. As part of his new responsibilities, Kevin will oversee areas such as Student Activities &amp; Events, Student Support (Admissions, Student Records &amp; Registration, Financial Aid), and the Dean of Students Office (Housing &amp; Student Living, Student Honor, Student Representation, Health Services, and Counseling).</p>
<p><br />"Kevin has served this university faithfully for nearly 20 years. He is a wonderful leader and a dedicated employee, and we look forward to the great work he will perform in this new position," said President Kim Clark.</p>
<p><br />Prior to coming to BYU-Idaho, Brother Miyasaki worked in juvenile corrections and mental health. He attended Ricks College and received a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University and a master's degree from Arizona State University-both in social work.</p>
<p><br />Leaving behind a legacy of service, Garth Hall has served the campus community since 1997. Brother Hall began work on campus as the director of Athletics. He was then named vice president of Advancement in 2001, and became the vice president of Student Services and Activities in 2006.</p>]]></BodyCopy><xPower Type="Component" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent" /><xPower Type="Component" Name="News" label="News" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="x28" CompTypes="NewsNavigationComponent" /><xPower Type="List" Name="ContentSnippet" label="Content Snippet" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="" List=""><xPower Type="Component" Name="xPower" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="" /></xPower><xPower Type="Navigation" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false" Navigation="Ancestors" GenerationOrder="down" StartPage="x5" MaxNodes="" MaxDepth="" Query="" /><xPower Type="Component" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Component="x10257" CompTypes="SiteControl" /></NewsDetail>
