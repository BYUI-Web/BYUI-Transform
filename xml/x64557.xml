If you have ever learned to play an instrument, you know that it&rsquo;s much more effective to practice for a short period every day than to practice for a very long time only once. This principle applies equally to every kind of learning, including language learning. You must insist that you both meet at least twice a week; the first meeting should be on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, and the second meeting on Thursday evening (after the weekly Pathway Gathering), Friday, or Saturday. But under no circumstances can you meet only once a week, even if that one meeting is longer than two meetings put together.]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
