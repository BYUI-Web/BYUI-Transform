We encourage you to visit the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/financialaid/fa/apply.htm">Financial Aid</a> website for detailed information. The online degree program allows you to use Federal Pell Grant  funds. Once you complete the FAFSA and the online degree admissions  application, the Financial Aid office can begin reviewing and processing  your financial aid options. In most cases, there is no credit minimum to be eligible for the Federal  Pell Grant. In order to be eligible for Federal Student Loans, however,  you must enroll at least half-time (6 credit hours).</p>]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
