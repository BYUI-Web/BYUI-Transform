To assist in this process and to show respect for everyone present, graduates are asked to adhere to BYU-Idaho's Dress and Grooming Standard of Sunday dress.</p>
<p>Additionally, so as not to draw attention to any one individual; flowers, leis, honor cords and other embellishments that might be considered academic regalia should not be attached to or worn with the cap and gown during the convocation or commencement ceremonies. However, outside of these ceremonies, the wearing of honor cords and other regalia are permitted for society and other graduation pictures.</p>
