<p><em>For further assistance, contact the Human Resources Desk at 208-496-1700 or humanresources@byui.edu.</em> <br /><br /><strong><a name="Can I work before I have done my employment paperwork at Human Resources?"></a>Question: Can I work before I have done my employment paperwork at Human Resources?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No. Although an employer may want to have you start work immediately, students must complete employment paperwork with Human Resources and receive approval from that office prior to beginning work.<br /><br /><strong><a name="I am looking for an on-campus job. Where do I go?"></a>Question: I am looking for an on-campus job. Where do I go?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> You can start your job search by looking at the job postings online at <a href="http://www.byui.edu/studentemployment" target="_parent">www.byui.edu/studentemployment</a>. Keep in mind that not every available job will be listed on the university's job postings, so it would be a good idea to contact the various on-campus departments to inquire about possible openings. <br /><br /><strong><a name="Can I work on campus during my off-track semester?"></a><a name="Can I work on capus during my off-track semester?"></a>Question: Can I work on campus during my off-track semester?<a href="http://www.byui.edu/studentemployment/FAQs.htm#5" target="_parent"> </a></strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes (assuming that you have been admitted to BYU-Idaho as a full-time student).<br /><br /><strong><a name="Why can international students work full-time on campus during their annual break?"></a>Question: Why can international students work full-time on campus during their annual break?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Because international students are limited in their employment options off campus, due to federal law, the University permits them to work on campus during their off-track ("annual break") semester. <br /><br /><strong><a name="Can I work over 20 hours this week and work less than 20 hours next week?"></a>Question: Can I work over 20 hours this week and work less than 20 hours next week?</strong><br /><strong>A: Non-International Students:&nbsp;</strong>Possibly. Under supervisor approval, you have the ability to work for two <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"rush" weeks per semester.<br /><strong>International Students:&nbsp;</strong>No. Unfortunately, working over 20 hours per week jeopardizes your visa status.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Can I bring in a copy of or fax my identification document (i.e. Social Security card, birth certificate, etc.)?"></a>Question: Can I bring in a copy of or fax my identification documents (i.e. Social Security card, birth certificate, etc.)?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No. We must see the original documents. However, we will accept the receipt after ordering a new Social Security card from the Social Security office in Idaho Falls until you receive the new card in the mail.<br /><br /><strong><a name="Where do I get paid?"></a>Question: Where do I get paid?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> If you sign up for DIRECT DEPOSIT, it will be deposited into your personal bank checking or savings account automatically. If you choose not to sign up for DIRECT DEPOSIT, you will&nbsp;need to pick up your pay at the Cashier's Office (located on the first floor of the Kimball building). Pay days are the 8th and 23rd of each month.<br /><br /><strong><a name="Where do I get a copy of my W-2 form?"></a>Question: Where do I get a copy of my W-2 form?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> W-2 forms are processed by the Accounting office (Kimball 130). They are mailed out at the beginning of the year in plenty of time for tax season. If you would like additional copies of your W-2, contact the Accounting office. You can also obtain a copy online at <a href="http://www.byui.edu/financial-services/payroll">http://www.byui.edu/financial-services/payroll</a>.<br /><br /><strong><a name="I need employment verification. What do I do?"></a>Question: I need an employment verification. What do I do?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Contact Becky McKnight in the Accounting office (Kimball 130).<br /><br /><strong><a name="Can I work in the same department as a relative?"></a>Question: Can I work in the same department as a relative?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Near relatives may not normally be employed where they will work in close proximity in administrative relationships or location. They may not be employed where their positions would cause management concerns about preferential treatment of a relative in such things as hiring, promoting, allocating salary, assigning duties, arranging schedules, allocating equipment or facilities, or handling discipline or termination. &nbsp;This policy applies to full-time, part-time, student, and temporary personnel.&nbsp;The university reserves the right to make an exception to this policy. <br /><br /><br /></p>
