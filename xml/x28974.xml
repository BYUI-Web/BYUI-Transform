<p>J.Ann was born in Afton, Wyoming and raised on a small family farm in Smoot, Wyoming, where she enjoyed riding horses, milking cows and taking care of the farm animals.  She and her husband were married in the Logan Temple and have five children and 27 grandchildren.  She was a stay-at-home mom until her children were married, then she went to work with LaMoyne in the family businesses doing payroll, accounts payable, taxes and insurances.  When they started the boat business she learned to fly fish, which is her favorite activity, except for spending time with their grandchildren and great-grandson.  She also enjoys quilting, cooking, bowling, gardening and taking care of their home.  She has served as an ordinance worker in the Idaho Falls Temple, Stake Missionary, Ward Relief Society President, Ward and Stake Young Women President, Sunday School teacher, Primary teacher, Visiting Teacher, a Relief Society advisor at BYU-I, and is currently serving with LaMoyne in the singles branch and on the President's Advancement Council at BYU-I.</p>
<p>LaMoyne was also raised on a small farm, in Auburn, Wyoming.  He started out shortly after his marriage to J.Ann building airplanes until he and J.Ann started and became owners of their own business, a large water treatment company that they later sold to start Hyde Drift Boat Inc., which manufactures and sells their products throughout the world.  He has been featured in fishing shows and competitions on ESPN, Outdoor Network, Sport Fishing on the Fly, Familiar Waters and numerous other shows with such individuals as Bobby Knight, Andy Griffith, Kurt Gowdy, Johnny Bench and Henry Winkler.  In 1999 he was appointed to the Governor's Economic Advisory Council by Governor Kirk Kempthorne.  He was subsequently appointed as the Director of the Department of Commerce for the State of Idaho and served there until Governor Kempthorne accepted an appointment in Washington DC, at which time LaMoyne came home to his real loves: fishing with his family and friends, and working in the Church.  He has served as Scoutmaster, Elders Quorum President, High Priest Group Leader, Ordinance worker in the Idaho Falls Temple, Stake Missionary, Gospel Doctrine teacher, High Councilman, Bishop in Idaho Falls and at BYU-I, and is currently serving with J.Ann in a Search and Recovery position in the singles branch in Idaho Falls and on the BYU-I President's Advancement Council.</p>
