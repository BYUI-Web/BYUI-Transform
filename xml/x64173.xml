<p>Professional development has long been emphasized at BYU-Idaho, but the implementation of the Learning Model requires a new level of improvement to achieve excellence in learning and teaching. The challenge is in taking the first steps. None of us would say in a television interview on the Taylor quad, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m against professional development in any form.&rdquo; We acknowledge the need for professional development, but we don&rsquo;t know how to start or make time to move forward in the right direction. Sometimes we may feel we are working our fingers to the bone and just getting &ldquo;bony fingers.&rdquo; <br /> The professional development opportunities listed below should help. Think of it like lunch at the Lion House Cafeteria. You get your tray and walk along. Some very tantalizing dishes are in front of you. You can choose. Maybe the best approach is to choose just one of the opportunities each semester. Put the Learning Model in Action Workshops or the Spori Summit on your tray. Savor that opportunity for a semester. It&rsquo;s a start. After all, &ldquo;The journey of a 1,000 miles starts with the first course.&rdquo;</p>

<li><strong>Academic Technology Training<br /> </strong>As you look at integrating technology into your teaching there are numerous resources to assist you. Using I-Learn, our Learning Management System, you will be able to deliver instruction, manage assignments, stay connected with your students, promote group work and collaboration, administer quizzes and exams, and track your students&rsquo; progress in your classes. The <a href="http://www.byui.edu/AT/FTC/default.htm">Faculty Technology Center</a> (FTC) is a resource to:  	
<ul>
<li>help you set up your courses in I-Learn, </li>
<li>provide support and training as you utilize it. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Come to the FTC (MCK 355) or call ext. 1592 for help. Online tutorials are available at this <a href="http://www.byui.edu/onlinelearning/employees/train_tut_faq.htm">link</a>, and a schedule of training workshops is <a href="http://www.byui.edu/at/ilearn_schedule.htm">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brown Bag Lunches<br /> </strong>You are invited to come to the Faculty Development Committee&rsquo;s Brown Bag Lunches to pick up a sandwich and a new idea or two. These informal gatherings are less about providing final answers to teaching problems; they are about &ldquo;stirring the pot&rdquo; by raising questions, highlighting examples, and providing a setting for cross-campus and cross-disciplinary conversations about teaching. Look for announcements via email from Peggy Clements as these dates approach. </li>

<li><strong>Learning Communities<br /> </strong>A BYU-Idaho L<em>earning Community</em> is a group of instructors in a collaborative program designed to improve teaching and learning. Whatever the topic of the group, the essential concern is always how to improve learning experiences in the classroom. Learning Communities are small groups (8-12) of instructors who have committed to work together to create a product for the rest of the university. For example, communities might work together on preparing documents on some aspect of the teaching and learning process for the Inspired Teaching and Learning website, they might prepare to lead a Brown Bag Lunch discussion on their topic, or they might share the results of an action research project at a professional conference. For more information, contact <a href="mailto:duquel@byui.edu">Lary Duque</a>, <a href="mailto:hawkesl@byui.edu">Lynda Hawkes</a>, or <a href="mailto:hunsakers@byui.edu">Steve Hunsaker</a>, who will be leading the Learning Communities for the 2008-2009 academic year. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Model in Action Workshops</strong><br /> You can get &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; experience developing your course or syllabus with other faculty in these workshops. Based on best practices from around campus and gleaned from professional literature, each session will provide opportunities to apply Learning Model principles with a group of 10-12 colleagues. The groups will meet once a week (over three consecutive weeks). To register for the workshop, email <a href="mailto:barkerde@byui.edu">Devan Barker</a> or <a href="mailto:schmidtb@byui.edu">Brian Schmidt</a>. </li>

<li><strong>Learning and Teaching Website</strong><br /> Use this resource to improve your instruction conveniently at your own pace and timeframe. The <a href="http://www.byui.edu/learningandteaching">Learning and Teaching Website</a> is the home for a series of two page summaries of educational tools and resources that are concise, jargon free, and available on demand. These summaries are framed around the Learning Model Process and share a variety of teaching methods that are practiced on campus. Examples, tips, and pitfalls are described. Additionally, articles are posted to highlight faculty experiences, review books, and share ideas to strengthen our educational efforts.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Spori Summit<br /> </strong>This off-site retreat is an opportunity for members of the faculty and administration to come together and share with each other their successes and challenges in teaching and learn about new ways to connect and support each other. In just two days, lasting friendships are formed and new ideas for teaching excellence are shared and incorporated by participants of the summit. Beneficial presentations and activities are lead by colleagues from our institution. The summit is held twice yearly, in the fall and summer semesters at the Quickwater Ranch in Victor, ID at the foot of the Tetons. The next summit is scheduled for October 9-11. We will leave about 2:00 pm on Thursday afternoon and return by noon on Saturday.
