He first heard about BYU-Idaho's Online Concurrent Enrollment Program when his brother applied for the program a couple of years earlier.</p>
<p>"I wanted to get ahead in college, and knowing some information about the Concurrent Enrollment Program from my brother and also my dad, who is a professor on campus, I went ahead and applied. Soon after I found out that I was accepted."</p>
<p>Joshua has maintained a 4.0 GPA in his Concurrent Enrollment and is currently taking two classes while working during his summer break. When asked where he gets his ambition and motivation from, he says his mother has been a big influence.</p>
<p>"When I was in junior high, my mom would monitor my grades and push me to work hard and get the best grades I could.&nbsp;&nbsp;From that, I have learned to stay focused and put forth the best effort I can in my classes."</p>
<p>Joshua graduated from high school this year and plans on majoring in computer science at BYU-Idaho. His dream job is to be a computer analyst for the CIA.</p>
<p>Joshua says "The main lesson I have learned is to be less focused on the grade, and more focused on the experience."</p>
<p>Joshua has some advice to give to students who may be thinking about joining BYU-Idaho's Concurrent Enrollment Program.</p>
<p>"Don't forget to do your homework and keep up with the reading assignments, but most importantly, don't look at your classes as work, but rather as a learning experience. You have to remember that these classes are not something you have to do, but something you chose to do."</p>]]></BodyCopy><xPower Type="Component" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="x18360" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Component" Name="News" label="News" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="NewsNavigationComponent" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="List" Name="ContentSnippet" label="Content Snippet" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded=""><xPower Type="Component" Name="xPower" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes=""/></xPower><xPower Type="Navigation" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false" Navigation="Ancestors" GenerationOrder="down" StartPage="x5" MaxNodes="" MaxDepth="" Query=""/><xPower Type="Component" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Component="x17147" CompTypes="SiteControl"/></NewsDetail>
