		help each other here. Teachers—all employees really—encourage and serve 
		students. And students support one another too. That’s the way it’s 
		always been at this school. The pioneers of the university understood 
		and lived lives of Christian service, and today’s Latter-day Saints 
		continue the tradition at Brigham Young University–Idaho. One clear and 
		inspiring example of this caring environment is the Department of 
		Academic Learning. This area, located at one end of the David O. McKay 
		Library, consists of centers in which fellow students provide 
		one-on-one, free, personalized tutoring. The need for tutors in college 
		is not uncommon, but it is unusual to have access to assistance without 
		having to pay by the hour.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;A student staff 
		provides students with assistance in various subjects including reading, 
		writing, math, study skills, and tutoring for most classes on campus. 
		This personalized assistance from peers helps many significantly 
		increase their ability to understand challenging class material.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;As a 
		philanthropic priority approved by the BYU–Idaho Board of Trustees, the 
		department receives financial support donated by alumni and friends. 
		That support provides wages for the tutors and even makes small 
		grants-in-aid possible. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;A SCENE OF 
		SIMULTANEOUS SERVICE&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;
		&lt;img border="2" src="../../../Images/BYUI Upward/spring2006/ctt3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="15" width="400" height="325"&gt;At 
		any given time, pairs of students are intently hovering over papers or 
		books. Oftentimes the seats in these comfortable, open rooms are filled 
		with students sitting at the rows and groupings of desks. To glance 
		across the scene is to witness charity. It is a gathering of those able 
		and willing to assist those in need—pure exchanges of giving and 
		receiving. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;The Department of 
		Academic Learning provides the means and the setting for many of those 
		moments to occur all at once, all day long.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;TURNING BACK 
		TO HELP ANOTHER&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;A testament to 
		the effectiveness of the program is that students who once needed 
		tutoring actually progress to the point of becoming tutors themselves.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;Greg Hazard, 
		department chair, directly observes ongoing growth in students every 
		semester. “We take students where they are and individually lift them to 
		a higher level of &lt;br&gt;
		learning,” he says. “In many cases the tutee becomes the &lt;br&gt;
		tutor. An example of this is Josh Muir who came to the tutoring center 
		two years ago to get help with his chemistry class. This year he is 
		tutoring for biology classes.”&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;Now-accomplished 
		young men and women have the opportunity to solidify their own knowledge 
		through the process of teaching. What they also offer, however, is 
		empathy and patience for those they tutor. The feelings that often come 
		from not easily grasping concepts along with the desperate desire to 
		succeed are fresh in their minds. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;Greg views 
		learning and teaching at the Learning Centers as a gratifying and 
		inspiring manifestation of the scripture, “Wherefore, he that preacheth 
		and he that receiveth, understand one another and both are edified and 
		rejoice together” (Doctrine and Covenants 50:22).&amp;nbsp; He observes, &lt;/font&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;The students 
		learn subject matter, but the tutors gain an appreciation for talents 
		their students have that they themselves don’t possess. Both the tutor 
		and the student begin to recognize the reality of having different 
		gifts, accepting those gifts, and sharing them. It is good, for example, 
		to see a math tutor getting help with writing in the Writing Center, and 
		a reading tutor getting help with math in the Math Center. They have 
		learned to both give and receive with dignity.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;MEASURABLE 
		SUCCESS&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;
		&lt;img border="2" src="../../../Images/BYUI Upward/spring2006/ctt4.jpg" width="400" height="325" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="15"&gt;Statistical 
		reports compliment the visible triumphs at the Learning Centers. In 2005 
		an impressive 7,041 different students were helped in one way or 
		another. These students (3,800 females and 3,241 males) made 79,947 
		visits. With a total of 82,338 hours of tutoring provided, an average of 
		12 hours was spent with each student. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;The success of 
		Academic Learning is measurable not only in the high percentage of 
		students who take advantage of at least one of the centers but also 
		through feedback from those helped. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;Student 
		evaluations of their tutors indicate that 88 percent of those assisted 
		achieve better grades, 44 percent say that without a tutor they would 
		drop their more difficult courses, and 90 percent report that because of 
		tutoring they actually like subjects they disliked prior to the tutoring 
		experience. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;Ironically the 
		greatest success for the Department of Academic Learning would be that, 
		after all the effort, it was no longer needed. “We want to work 
		ourselves out of a job,” Greg says with a smile. “This means that one 
		kind of success is when a student says something like, ‘Thanks for your 
		help, but I don’t need you anymore. I can do it on my own now.’ We are 
		happy to see them move on.” &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;RELIEVING 
		DISCOURAGEMENT&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;In general the 
		university experience is a difficult one in which learning how to learn 
		becomes just as important as the knowledge gained. Some who go to 
		college, however, truly lack certain study or learning skills and 
		struggle far more than the average student. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;Students who deal 
		with learning disabilities that may have originated in secondary or even 
		elementary school soon realize the scholastic survival methods employed 
		in the past will not hold up for university-level courses. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;These students 
		with extraordinary learning difficulties would not even consider the 
		possibility of receiving a scholarship; yet to assist such students and 
		reward their dedicated efforts, Academic Learning has been able to 
		provide a select few with small grants-in-aid. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;This unexpected 
		showing of confidence literally renews a struggling student’s hope and 
		changes the lives of these young people forever. The financial support, 
		though often minimal, gives those BYU–Idaho students a boost. It adds to 
		their self-respect and personal expectations to succeed not only in 
		school but also at home, in the Church, and in their future vocations or 
		professions. They realize someone believes in them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;A BENEFIT TO 
		THE TUTORS&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;Students with 
		learning or developmental challenges are not the only ones who benefit; 
		approximately 300 student tutors are employed by Academic Learning. 
		These students not only benefit from the paid position, but they are 
		able to broaden their experience, increase their knowledge, and discover 
		the joys of serving through their employment as tutors. Many of them 
		later look for further employment opportunities that are 
		service-oriented, and some ultimately pursue teaching as a lifetime 
		career.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&lt;b&gt;ENSURING 
		ONGOING ASSISTANCE&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;The cycle of 
		service is far-reaching. Individuals and foundations, such as the Smith 
		Family Foundation, help fund the BYU–Idaho Department of Academic 
		Learning Endowment.* Through this fund, tutors are paid; other students 
		receive much-needed assistance and even small grants; some of those 
		helped are then hired to help others; and some will turn back and donate 
		to the priority as well.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;Establishing this 
		endowment will ensure permanent funding for grants to aspiring students 
		in need of special learning assistance and provide wages for tutors, 
		helping finance their education. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;The endowment 
		will also provide much needed materials and facilities and offset some 
		of the added costs for developmental courses some students should take 
		before they can enroll in regular classes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;Under the 
		direction of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church, LDS Philanthropies 
		(with offices at BYU–Idaho) welcomes and facilitates gifts to the 
		Department of Academic Learning as well as all other philanthropic 
		priorities. For more information, call (800) 227-4257 or visit

		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;On behalf of the 
		Department of Academic Learning, Greg Hazard shares, “Students are 
		constantly in my office thanking me for the services of the tutors and 
		the Learning Centers. I wish there was a way I could pass that gratitude 
		on to the
		&lt;img border="2" src="../../../Images/BYUI Upward/spring2006/ctt5.jpg" width="318" height="295" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="15"&gt;administrators, 
		Board of Trustees, and donors who so graciously support the department 
		and its mission. It is a fabulous feeling to be part of something that 
		changes so many lives for good.”&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;font face="Franklin Gothic Book"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
