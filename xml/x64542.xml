<p><strong>Reading and Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Part 1: Together with your speaking partner, read <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng" target="_blank">Alma 60</a>, which is Moroni's letter to Pahoran. Take turns reading verses beginning with your Speaking Partner. If you wish, pause at different points to discuss anything you don't understand or to discuss some of the thoughts you are having while reading. Ask your Speaking Partner to explain any words or phrases that are not clear. Your Speaking Partner can help with pronunciation whenever they feel it is necessary or they can wait until the end.</p>
<p>Part 2: Share your thoughts on Moroni's letter. You may wish to discuss the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>What were the different concerns or issues that Moroni wrote to Pahoran in his letter?</li>
<li>In this unit, you are writing a letter to someone to "Take a Stand." Describe the ways that Moroni took a stand on the issues that were concerning him and the people he was over.</li>
<li>Moroni indicated that he is "murmuring" and "complaining." Are there times when we should complain? If so, when? Or, do you think that Moroni was murmuring and complaining?</li>
<li>Moroni did not know what was happening in Zarahemla, but from his perspective, he thought that Pahoran was enjoying his position of power and that he didn't care about those who were out fighting. Many times in our lives, we may not know all the facts, but from our perspective, it may seem that there is a better way to do something. How should we respond in such situations?</li>
<li>Describe the structure of Moroni's letter. In other words, how did he start his letter, what did he include in the introduction to the issue, what other details or topics did he describe, and how did he conclude?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Speaking</strong></p>
<p>Part 1: Choose a topic from the <a href="Documents/Admin_Offices/Online Learning/Online Instruction/Speaking Partner ENG/Topic List Week 11.pdf">topic list</a> to discuss with your speaking partner. Make sure you provide any background information necessary for them to understand what you are "taking a stand on" and then explain what you would say to whomever you have chosen. Answer any questions the speaking partner may have.</p>

<p><strong>Reading and Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Part 1: Together with your speaking partner, read <a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/61?lang=eng" target="_blank">Alma 61</a>, which is Pahoran's letter back to Moroni. Take turns reading verses beginning with your Speaking Partner. If you wish, pause at different points to discuss anything you don't understand or to discuss some of the thoughts you are having while reading. Ask your Speaking Partner to explain any words or phrases that are not clear. Your Speaking Partner can help with pronunciation whenever they feel it is necessary or they can wait until the end.</p>
<p>Part 2: Share your thoughts on Pahoran's response to Moroni. You may wish to discuss the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>How did Pahoran's letter differ from Moroni's?</li>
<li>Describe Pahoran's reaction to Moroni's chastisement (harsh criticism).</li>
<li>Again, Moroni did not know what was happening in Zarahemla, and Pahoran could have responded in the same way, but he didn't. How should we respond in such situations?</li>
<li>Pahoran's response letter not only expressed concern for the difficulties Moroni and his people were facing, but he also "took a stand" on the issues that were occurring in Zarahemla. Describe the ways that Pahoran took a stand on the issues that were occurring and the people he was over.</li>
<li>What plan did Pahoran recommend?</li>
<li>Describe the structure of Pahoran's response letter. In other words, how did he start his letter, what did he include in the introduction to the issue he was facing in Zarahemla, what other details or topics did he describe, and how did he conclude?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p>During this part of the session, you will do a timed writing assignment. You will write at least three paragraphs. It will relate to the content in the unit. For this time writing, imagine that you are either Moroni or Pahoran. After you choose which one you want to be, consider the individual's situation and background knowledge and write a letter to the other to "Take a Stand" on the issue. If you choose to be Moroni, you can choose to write a letter similar to his first letter (considering that he didn't know what was happening in Zarahemla) or you can write another response to Pahoran's letter.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open a new, blank document in Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>Step 2: Plan your writing (2-4 minutes).</p>
<p>Step 3: Write your short essay (10-12 minutes).</p>
<p>Step 4: Edit your writing (2-4 minutes).</p>
<p>Step 5: Save your writing.</p>
<p>Step 6: Copy and paste your writing into the instant message area on Skype. Your Speaking Partner will read it and give you feedback during your tutor session. Think of at least one question you can ask your Speaking Partner about something that will help you improve what you wrote.</p>
<p>Step 7: If you wish, revise your writing. Use the feedback your Speaking Partner discussed with you. Save your writing again.</p>
<p>Step 8: After your session, answer the questions above. Then copy and paste your writing into the box as well. Your instructor will read through it and may also give you some feedback.</p>
