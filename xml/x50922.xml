<h2><strong>SECTION ONE</strong></h2>
<strong> Building a Strong Relationship, Not Just Supporting a Marriage</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br /> <em>Knowing how to overcome conflicts in marriage</em> <br /> <br /> <strong>Scenario</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Laura and Justin are married students attending BYU-Idaho. They have been married for almost two years now and still feel just as in love as they did when they first got married. They try very hard to attend the temple regularly, read and study their scriptures together and individually, and have a date night every Friday night. However, recently the pressures of school, work, and the idea of "wifely duties" have started to overwhelm Laura. She has tried to balance her school, work schedule, laundry, and cleaning but this semester is so hard on her and she is starting to feel very alone. She never wanted to ask for Justin to help with cleaning, but she appreciates it when he offers and lately she feels as though he doesn't care enough to ask if she would like some help around the house. Instead of talking to Justin about her frustrations Laura has started to hold in more and more frustrations and no longer looks forward to doing things as a couple, such as going to the temple, praying, reading scriptures, or having a date. She has also found herself getting angry at Justin and has begun to yell at him for every little thing that he does. Justin does not know what to do or why Laura is so upset.</div>

<strong>Importance of Time together</strong></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">If we want our marriages to become celestial, we must be willing to devote time to our partners. Much of that time must be away from the children and must involve more than being in the same room together. Culprits like television can destroy the value of time spent together. Both quantity and quality of time are essential to successful, thriving marriages. If you feel pressed for more time, put your imagination to work and try some new ideas. Whatever you and your spouse do to share more time together, your marriage depends on it. (Dee W. Hadley, "<a href="http://www.lds.org/ensign/1987/12/it-takes-time?lang=eng&amp;query=Quality+Time+couple#pop_001-03220_000_014" target="_blank">It Takes Time</a>",&nbsp;Dec 1987).</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">"Love is like a flower, and, like the body, it needs constant feeding. The mortal body would soon be emaciated and die if there were not frequent feedings. The tender flower would wither and die without food and water. And so love, also, cannot be expected to last forever unless it is continually fed with portions of love, the manifestation of esteem and admiration, the expressions of <a href="http://www.lds.org/topic/gratitude/" target="_blank">gratitude</a>, and the consideration of unselfishness." (Spencer W. Kimball, "Marriage and Divorce", Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1976, pp. 22-23).</div>

<h2><strong>SECTION THREE</strong></h2>
<strong></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Scenario #1</strong>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Bill and Liz are both students and are on different track systems. Liz has maintained good employment throughout her college experience and is able to work a flexible schedule during her on-track and works full-time in her off track at a local business. Bill has worked early morning janitorial, but has a hard time getting up that early in the morning due to staying up late at night gaming. Bill has worked sporadically, both on and off campus. This is Bill's off-track and again, he is seeking meaningful employment. Because he isn't working and doesn't have homework, Bill spends much of his time playing video games and watching movies. Liz goes to bed earlier than Bill because she has early classes and a full day of work. She gets home around seven each night and then studies a few hours and goes to bed. She knows that Bill is a hard-working man and that he feels bad about not having employment. He spends time everyday checking job postings and turning in resumes. He is trying, and he does help out at home with laundry and shopping. However, Liz lays in bed each night listening to Bill playing games and cannot help but feel resentful that she is working so hard at her job while maintaining her studies, and that Bill seems to be on vacation. They seldom talk, except to greet one another or to relay information.</div>
<br />
<div><strong>Scenario #2</strong>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Bob and Amy met playing on a Recreational Basketball League two years ago, which began a fairy-tale romance and soon after, a wedding. For the first year of marriage, Bob and Amy continued to play basketball with Rec. Sports. It was time spent doing what they love, time spent together, and time spend in physical exercise. This year is different, however. With a new baby, Amy is trying to exercise and get back in shape. Bob and Amy signed up for basketball once again and took the baby in a baby carrier with them to practice. With three times a week practices occurring at 9:00pm, Amy realized that keeping the baby up until 11:00 a few times a week was affecting sleep for the whole family, as the baby woke throughout the night crying due to an inconsistent schedule. Amy dropped the team and began staying home with their new baby. Amy still attended Bob's games to cheer him on. She felt sad to not be playing and missed the good exercise it provided. Amy feels as if she has given up something she loves just to stay home and be sedentary. Amy realizes that the baby will grow, but then she wonders how to entertain a toddler on the sidelines, and then comes more children. It might be several years before Amy can play again if the present situation is any indication of what life will be like with children.</div>

</ol><hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<h2><strong>SECTION FOUR</strong></h2>
</div>
<div><br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">"As husbands and wives, how well do we know each other? Most of us knew enough about our spouse at one time to agree to marriage. But what have we learned about each other since then? People-and consequently marriages-change as the years go by.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Some husbands and wives are surprised to find that there are still things to learn about each other, even after several years of marriage. Some mistakenly believe that because they live together in the same house, they'll automatically know each other. Others assume that they each share the same perspective of their marriage-that since they are "one," they think exactly alike, enjoy exactly the same things, and derive exactly the same satisfaction from their relationship. And some even erroneously assume that because they love each other, each will always know what the other is thinking or feeling, so there's no need to express thoughts and sentiments.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Whatever the reasons, dialogue is infrequent or missing in too many marriages."</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">To assist in marital communication, try the following exercise together. Allow yourselves sufficient time when there will be no interruptions. You might wish to divide the exercise into several sessions, considering two or three statements at each session.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">First, respond individually in writing to the statements. Then exchange papers and talk about what you've written. Don't try to review your responses simultaneously. While one of you is reading or speaking, the other should listen or ask clarifying questions. Then switch roles.</div>
