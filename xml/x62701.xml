</li>
<li>When purchases are made under a contract, the contract number should be referenced as documentation for these transactions.  Purchasing Department personnel can make these purchases according to the levels described in the Church Purchasing Domestic Handbook.  However, any purchases over $100,000 must receive approval through the BYU-Idaho and CES approval and appropriation process.</li>
<li>Contracted purchases can be made without the involvement of the Purchasing Department if the guidelines listed below are followed:  
<ul style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; padding-left: 30px; list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Approval has been given by the Supervisor of the budget steward and the Director of the Purchasing Department within an identified dollar amount.</li>
<li>Purchases are made according to the contract terms and conditions.</li>
<li>The contract number is referenced on the invoice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emergency purchases can be made by contacting a Purchasing Department representative and obtaining authorization.  Emergency purchases are classified as situations where life or safety is at risk and where immediate purchases must be made to eliminate or reduce this risk.</li>
<li>When the Purchasing Department has placed the order with a vendor, a copy of the Purchase Order (PO) will be sent to the requesting department.  The department should place the PO in an Open File for reference when the items are received and when the charge appears on the accounting reports.</li>
<li>When using the University Purchasing Card, policies governing these purchases must be followed (see <a href="x24765.xml" title="Purchasing Card Policy">Purchasing Card Policy</a>).</li>
