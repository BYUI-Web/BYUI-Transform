<div class="scroll-pane">
<p>Registering for your first semester of college classes is an exciting milestone, but can also seem overwhelming. We encourage you to work with Advising and Academic Support to arrange a schedule that strengthens your weaknesses and builds a solid foundation to a successful college experience. Please be aware of the following planning considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="liHeader">Plan to take Foundations courses first</span><br />The Foundations Program is BYU-Idaho’s core of general education courses. You are required to take certain classes, called pre-requisites, before you can register for other classes: FDENG 101, FDAMF 101, FDSCI 101, and FDMAT 108. In addition, we recommend you take a Book of Mormon class (FDREL 121, 122). </li>
<li><span class="liHeader">Plan for the correct amount of credits</span><br />In order to complete a bachelor’s degree requiring 120 credits in eight semesters (four years), you must take at least 15 credits per semester. However, to be technically classified as full-time, you must take at least 12 credits per semester. And in order to be eligible for BYU-Idaho scholarships, you must take at least 14 credits.</li>
<li><span class="liHeader">Understand what your Advanced Placement (AP) or Concurrent Enrollment (CE) credits fulfill</span><br />Many AP and concurrent enrollment classes satisfy Foundations requirements. AP scores must be submitted to our Student Records and Registration Office on an official AP transcript. For a complete list of AP credit given, click <a href="http://www.byui.edu/catalog/2011-2012/Academic%20Policies.pdf">here</a>. CE classes will be evaluated and accepted using guidelines established by our transfer evaluation department. CE classes may satisfy Foundations requirements, may be the equivalent of a class currently offered at BYU-Idaho, or may be accepted as elective credit. To see how your CE classes may transfer, click <a href="http://www.byui.edu/catalog/2011-2012/Transfer Students.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li><span class="liHeader">Create a plan for first semester success</span><br />The Academic Discovery Center has created a recommended course sequences for each major. These plans recommend certain classes from your major as well as elective or Foundations classes. Click <a href="http://www.byui.edu/academic-discovery-center/students/academic-advising-and-class-planning/class-planning/recommended-course-sequences">here </a>to see a list of the majors with their accompanying plans.</li>

<h3 class="map_headings">If you are an International student, you will need to be aware of how to maintain your immigration status. Please consider the following:</h3>
<hr />
<a href="#top">Return to top</a> <br /> 
<ul>
<li>As an International student, you have a track assignment; however, an override to attend the off-track semester is allowed. The requirements for the override are to attend on-track semesters full time, and have at least a 2.5 GPA. </li>
<br />
<li>To maintain immigration status you need to take at least 12 credits each semester and only 3 online or distance learning credits can be counted towards the 12. (You can take more, but only 3 can be counted towards the 12)</li>
<br />
<li>Deferments, internships, and study abroad trips can all affect immigration status. International Services should be contacted beforehand for confirmation on status.</li>
<br />
<li>On-track employment is limited to 20 hours per week and students must be full-time. Off-track International students can work more than 20 hours with no credit requirements. </li>
<br />
<li>Be aware of academic support resources. BYU-Idaho has a wonderful Academic Support Center, located in McKay 290 (in the east wing on the 2nd floor of the McKay Library). Specifically, the center includes an English Transitional Center and courses like Eng 106-109 that benefit many of our International students. </li>

<div id="disabled">
<h3 class="map_headings">If you are a student with disabilities, please be aware of the following:</h3>
<hr />
<a href="#top">Return to top</a> <br /> 
<ul>
<li>BYU-Idaho has a Disability Service Center that provides services for classroom and other university related activities and operates at the request of any BYU-I student with qualifying disabilities. <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Disabilities/" title="BYU-Idaho Disabilities Home" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more information. </li>
<br />
<li>We have advisors in every college on campus that can assist you in planning for success.</li>
<br />
<li>Typically, to be classified as full-time, you must take at least 12 credits. In order to be eligible for scholarships from BYU-Idaho, you must take at least 14 credits and in order to complete a bachelor's degree requiring 120 credits in a traditional, eight-semester time frame, you would need at least 15 credits per semester. However, please be aware that you may seek accommodation to take fewer credits if it is appropriate for your situation.</li>
<br />
<li>BYU-Idaho has a wonderful Academic Support Center, located in McKay 290 (in the east wing on the 2nd floor of the McKay Library). You should know that the Academic Support Center is for everyone, and that tutoring is free. The Support Center includes services in Reading, Writing, Math, Content Tutoring, Study Skills, as well as an English Transitional Center. Over 8,000 students use the Support Center each semester, and 94% believe they receive better grades because of it. Remember to sign up quickly; the most repeated comment on student surveys is something like, "I wish I'd known about this sooner!" </li>

<div id="transfer">
<h3 class="map_headings">As a new transfer student at BYU-Idaho, please consider the following:</h3>
<hr />
<a href="#top">Return to top</a> <br /> 
<ul>
<li>Students who are not yet admitted can look up course equivalencies on the student records and registration website under <a href="http://www.byui.edu/registrarsoffice/CollegeCourseEquivalencies.htm" title="Transfer Evaluation" target="_blank">transfer evaluation</a> to get an idea of how transfer courses will be processed.</li>
<br />
<li>BYU-Idaho accepts college-level transfer credits from regionally accredited colleges and universities. Technical and vocational courses are typically not accepted. (e.g. dental assisting courses) If BYU-I offers a direct course equivalency to the transfer course it will be accepted to fulfill a specific BYU-Idaho course credit. Once admitted to BYU-Idaho a transfer evaluation will be completed. Students will then be able to review their unofficial transcripts which will specify whether a course has a direct equivalency or if it has been accepted as elective credit. (Admitted students will be able to view their unofficial transcripts by logging into <a href="http://my.byui.edu">my.byui.edu</a> and looking in their student tab.) If BYU-Idaho does not offer an equivalent, the course will generally transfer as elective credit. Students may petition a specific department for an adjustment or substitution regarding certain transfer courses. Please contact the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/academic-discovery-center/about-us/locations" title="Satellite Academic Discovery Centers" target="_blank">Satellite Academic Discovery Center</a> for your major to obtain further information regarding these options.</li>
<br />
<li>Your transfer GPA will not factor into your BYU-Idaho GPA. </li>
<br />
<li>Transferring with an associate degree can affect/reduce your requirements here at BYU-Idaho. An Associate of Art or Science degree from a regionally accredited college or university will fulfill BYU-Idaho Foundations requirements except for the FDCNC 250 course and any required religion courses. Students transferring with an Applied Associate degree will have their courses individually evaluated. Religion credit earned at CES Institutes of Religion or other Church schools will transfer as elective credit when the following conditions are met: (1) the course number is 100 or above; (2) a letter grade is given; and (3) course was taken for credit. The religion requirement for students will be adjusted according to the amount of transfer credit. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/catalog/2011-2012/University%20Requirements.pdf" title="Religion Credit" target="_blank">following chart</a> (pg.53) to get an accurate idea of the amount of religion credit you will need as a transfer student in order to complete your religion requirement. Additionally, students completing courses at the BYU Jerusalem Center or Nauvoo may receive up to 6 credits in religion which will count toward BYU-Idaho religion requirement.*</li>
<br />
<li>Transfer credit over 10 years old must be assessed separately. College courses taken from a regionally accredited college or university that are ten or more years old will transfer to BYU-Idaho as elective credit and will require a petitioning process in order to meet major or minor requirements. Please see your declared major's <a href="http://www.byui.edu/academic-discovery-center/about-us/locations" title="Satellite Academic Discovery Centers" target="_blank">Satellite Academic Discovery Center</a> to work with an advisor on this process. Transfer courses older than ten years will not be able to be petitioned to fulfill Foundations requirements. If, however, you are transferring an associate degree that is older than ten years it will fulfill most foundation requirements except for FDCNC 250 and any unfinished religion.</li>
<br />
<li>Students are required to complete a total of 30 upper division credits at BYU-Idaho to receive their degree.</li>
<br />
<li>To be classified as full-time, you must take at least 12 credits. In order to be eligible for scholarships from BYU-Idaho, you must take at least 14 credits. In order to complete a bachelor's degree requiring 120 credits in a traditional, eight-semester time frame, you must take at least 15 credits per semester. We encourage you to take at least 12 credits, and closer to 15, each semester. This will allow you to complete your degree in a timely manner as well as be successful in your coursework.</li>
<br />
<li>AP, concurrent enrollment or CLEP credits may fulfill Foundations requirements. Many AP and concurrent enrollment classes will satisfy GE/Foundations requirements and thus hasten completion of your degree. AP scores must be on an official Advanced Placement transcript and should be sent to our Student Records and Registration office. For a complete list of AP credit given, click <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/catalog/2011-2012/Academic%20Policies.pdf">here</a>. Concurrent Enrollment (CE) classes will be evaluated and accepted using the articulation guidelines established by our Transfer Evaluation department. CE classes may satisfy Foundations/GE requirements, may be the equivalent of a class currently offered at BYU-Idaho, or may be accepted as elective credit. For a list of classes from the university or college through which you took your CE classes and to see how those classes may transfer, click <a href="https://my.byui.edu/ICS/Academics/Transfer_Courses.jnz" title="CE class lists">here</a>.</li>
