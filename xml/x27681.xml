Because of birthdates, track assignments, etc., many potential students in the past were unable to attend BYU-Idaho for 1 or 2 semesters prior to their missions. PMP was developed to facilitate this. The program consists of specific core courses that have been chosen because of their application to mission preparation. Core courses are taught in Learning Communities where the same students attend all core courses together. Learning Communities foster unity and learning by establishing the principle of teaching one another and focusing on community success.</p>]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
