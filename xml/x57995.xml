<p>Michael was born and raised in Southern California.  When he was 22 he went to Salt Lake City on vacation.  He went to the visitors' center where he was introduced to the gospel as taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  He was familiar with the gospel because his mother read bible stories to him and his sisters when they were young.  He continued to attend the Lutheran church on his own throughout his young adult years and eventually drifted away.  As a result of his visit to Salt Lake City he listened to the missionaries, accepted what they had to say, knew it was true and was baptized 5 months later.  He was active in the Young Adult program of the Church where he met Charlene Sands.  They fell in love and were sealed in the Los Angeles temple.  Michael and Charlene have lived in So. Cal.; St. George, UT; Rantoul, IL; Tacoma, WA; Glendale and Peoria, AZ; Mainz-Laubenheim, Germany; Aurora and Castle Rock, CO.  They consider Colorado home where they have lived for the last 16 years.  Michael currently serves in the Church as a Home Teacher and has served as a Ward Clerk, Finance Clerk, in several bishoprics, Stake High Counsel, Stake Mission Presidency, High Priest Group Leader, and Stake Missionary among other callings.</p>
<p>Charlene Sands Castaldo was born in Southern California and joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when she was 15.  She has served in the Church ever since.  After high school, while attending the Young Adults, she met Michael.  He was a recent convert.  A year later they married in the Los Angeles Temple.  They have been married for 34 years.  Since that time she was happy to able to stay at home and raise three children, each born in a different state.  She has served in a variety of callings over the years including, Cub Scout Leader, Nursery Leader, Primary Teacher, some primary presidencies, YW President, Relief Society Teacher, some Relief Society Presidencies, Stake Primary Secretary, Early Morning Seminary Teacher, Stake Missionary, Ward Missionary, and Temple Ordinance Worker.</p>
