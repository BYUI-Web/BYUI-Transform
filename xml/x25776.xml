"I know of no other practice which will make one more attractive in conversation than to be well-read in a variety of subjects. &nbsp;There is a great potential within each of us to go on learning. &nbsp;Regardless of our age, unless there be serious illness, we can read, study, drink in the writings of wonderful men and women. &nbsp;It is never too late to learn."</h5>
