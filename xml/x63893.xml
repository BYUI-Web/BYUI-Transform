<p><strong>Scenario #1</strong></p>
<p>Bill and Liz are both students and are on different track systems. Liz has maintained good employment throughout her college experience and is able to work a flexible schedule during her on-track and works full-time in her off track at a local business. Bill has worked early morning janitorial, but has a hard time getting up that early in the morning due to staying up late at night gaming. Bill has worked sporadically, both on and off campus. This is Bill's off-track and again, he is seeking meaningful employment. Because he isn't working and doesn't have homework, Bill spends much of his time playing video games and watching movies. Liz goes to bed earlier than Bill because she has early classes and a full day of work. She gets home around seven each night and then studies a few hours and goes to bed. She knows that Bill is a hard-working man and that he feels bad about not having employment. He spends time everyday checking job postings and turning in resumes. He is trying, and he does help out at home with laundry and shopping. However, Liz lays in bed each night listening to Bill playing games and cannot help but feel resentful that she is working so hard at her job while maintaining her studies, and that Bill seems to be on vacation. They seldom talk, except to greet one another or to relay information.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Scenario #2</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Bob and Amy met playing on a Recreational Basketball League two years ago, which began a fairy-tale romance and soon after, a wedding. For the first year of marriage, Bob and Amy continued to play basketball with Rec. Sports. It was time spent doing what they love, time spent together, and time spend in physical exercise. This year is different, however. With a new baby, Amy is trying to exercise and get back in shape. Bob and Amy signed up for basketball once again and took the baby in a baby carrier with them to practice. With three times a week practices occurring at 9:00pm, Amy realized that keeping the baby up until 11:00 a few times a week was affecting sleep for the whole family, as the baby woke throughout the night crying due to an inconsistent schedule. Amy dropped the team and began staying home with their new baby. Amy still attended Bob's games to cheer him on. She felt sad to not be playing and missed the good exercise it provided. Amy feels as if she has given up something she loves just to stay home and be sedentary. Amy realizes that the baby will grow, but then she wonders how to entertain a toddler on the sidelines, and then comes more children. It might be several years before Amy can play again if the present situation is any indication of what life will be like with children.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions to Consider:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Why is keeping similar schedules important to protecting and strengthening a relationship?</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>How do couples maintain common interests?</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>What could Bob and Amy do to allow both some exercise and enjoyment in physical activity?</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>What needs to change in order for these couples to spend quality time together?</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>In what ways could each person be showing prideful or selfish thoughts or actions?</p>
