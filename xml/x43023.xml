<h4>What is WELLNESS?</h4>
<p>The National Wellness Institute defines wellness as &ldquo;the active process through which people become aware of, and make choices toward, a more successful existence.&rdquo; Many times, we think of wellness in physical terms only &ndash; being active and without illness. However, wellness involves all aspects of our lives and focuses on bringing these into balance.</p>
