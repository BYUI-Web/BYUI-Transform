<p><strong>Thursday, April 24: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>ROCKY III</em></span></strong><br />In this exciting continuation of the Rocky saga, heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa finds himself lost in the fame and glory of celebrity, being defeated by rough up and coming boxer Clubber Lang. Having lost that edge, The Eye of the Tiger, he must train with former rival Apollo Creed in order to reclaim his title, his passion, and his pride.<br /><br /> TRIVIA FACT: Star Sylvester Stallone originally wanted Another One Bites the Dust by Queen to be the theme song for the film, but he was unable to secure the rights. &nbsp;Instead, rock band Survivor wrote the song Eye of The Tiger to be the film's theme song, which reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1983 and has gone on to become a classic rock legend.<br /><br /><strong> Thursday, May 15: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>JURASSIC PARK</em></span></strong><br /> In an adventure 65 Million Years in the making, wide-eyed idealist John Hammond has managed to create an amusement park by reverse-engineering dinosaur DNA and bringing the legendary beasts back to life. &nbsp;To ensure the safety of the park, he has hired a team comprised of paleontologists Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler, as well as chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm. &nbsp;What should be a routine tour becomes an ancient nightmare, as a vicious storm rips through&nbsp;the park's security, unleashing the dinosaurs upon its guests.<br /><br /> TRIVIA FACT: The dinosaurs in the film were created by a combination of stop-motion animation techniques, Stan Winston Studio's robotic puppets, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic's computer graphics imagery. &nbsp;The success of this film proved to filmmakers and studious that technology was advanced enough to create worlds and characters out of CGI, and led to the creation of such films as Star Wars Episode I, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br /><br /> <strong>Thursday, May 29: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>REAR WINDOW</em></span></strong><br /> Starring the legendary James Stewart and directed by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, this thriller features professional photographer L.B. Jefferies, who is confined to his apartment following an accident that left him with a broken leg. &nbsp;With boredom setting in, he keeps himself occupied by watching his neighbors go about their daily lives, until one day he notices the wife of a married couple disappear following a heated argument. &nbsp;Is the wife simply out of town, or has something more sinister happened to her? It's up to Jeff to find out!<br /><br /> TRIVIA FACT: This is the second of four movies to feature the partnership of director Alfred Hitchcock and star James Stewart. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is also ranked #28 on IMDB's list of the Top 250 Movies of All Time.<br /><br /><strong>Thursday, June 5: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>TOY STORY</em></span></strong><br /> What if toys were alive? And if they were alive, what would happen if one of them got lost? Those are the driving questions behind this 1995 classic. &nbsp;Cowboy toy Woody and spaceman toy Buzz Lightyear end up left behind at a gas station, and they must put their differences aside in order to return home before their owner, Andy, moves away and leaves them behind forever!<br /><br /> TRIVIA FACT: This was not only the first full-length feature film by Pixar, but also the first full-length computer animated film. &nbsp;If that alone wasn't enough to generate hype and interest, a massive marketing campaign which included video games and special edition Crunch Candy Bars took the country by storm in 1995. &nbsp;It all paid off, as this became the highest grossing film of the year, beating out heavy hitters Batman Forever and GoldenEye 007.<br /><br /> <strong>Thursday, July 3:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> SUPERMAN</em></span></strong><br /> With the planet Krypton about to be consumed by a dying son, the scientist Jor-El places his sun Kal-El in a spaceship bound for Earth. &nbsp;Not only will this give Kal-El a chance at life, but it will also give him the chance to become humanity's greatest hero, the legendary Superman. &nbsp;You will believe a man can fly in this epic film that not only captured the spirit of the comics, but proved that comic book superheros could be taken seriously as movies.<br /><br /> TRIVIA FACT: The success of this film laid the groundwork for all future superhero films to build upon. &nbsp;The concept of casting famous, Oscar winning actors in supportive roles coupled with an unknown for the main role started here, and has been followed by modern films such as Captain America, Thor, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and even Man of Steel. &nbsp;Another concept started by this film is to make a superhero film be an origin story, and also be faithful to the source material. &nbsp;Although common sense now, it was quite the innovation back then considering comic books weren't taken as seriously as they are now.</p>
