How do I fill so much time?</OpenningText><BodyCopy type="dhtml" label="Answer Text" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false"><![CDATA[<p>The assignments we&rsquo;ve provided should be a starting point only. The most important thing about these meetings is that you and the student practice authentic English. If you finish the assignment quickly, find other things to talk about. Review <a href="http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/teaching-guides/pedagogical/blooms-taxonomy/" target="_blank">Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy</a> and see if you can guide your partner to higher levels of speaking and learning. You are free to talk about anything you&rsquo;d like (within the bounds of appropriateness, of course). Ask what they learned in Sunday School or Institute this week; have them describe what they cooked for dinner or the route they take to get from their home to the Institute building. Ask the student to plan a way to use the principles you talked about or to analyze something you both read or discussed.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you do not make it through everything in the assignment, don&rsquo;t stress over it! It&rsquo;s more important that your partner has a chance to practice speaking and listening to English than that you cover every last bit of the assignment.</p>]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
