<p><strong><img name="faq1" />How will Winter 2013 registration change?</strong></p>
<p>Priority registration for Winter Semester 2013 will generally be unchanged from past semesters.&nbsp; The most significant change involves reserving the DAY sections of the four Gateway Foundations courses for freshmen and limiting registration into these DAY sections to two.</p>
<p>Beginning Wednesday, November 21, new freshmen will be eligible to register for these courses.&nbsp; A week later, beginning Wednesday, November 28, all remaining freshmen will gain access to these courses.&nbsp; The following week, beginning Wednesday, December 5, all non-freshmen will be given access to any remaining seats in these DAY sections.</p>
<p><strong><img name="faq2" />What is the purpose of this change?</strong></p>
<p>It is an effort to facilitate a smoother transition for new freshmen into BYU-Idaho and into the four required Gateway Foundations courses.&nbsp; This change will give new BYU-Idaho freshmen priority in registering for these courses for Winter 2013 semester.&nbsp; It will also give second priority to second semester freshmen.</p>
<p>The focus on helping freshmen get seats in these courses is due to the fact that these courses have been designed and intended for freshmen students.&nbsp; If a freshman doesn't complete these courses early in their academic experience, it can impact the sequencing of their subsequent time at BYU-Idaho.</p>
<p><strong><img name="faq3" />Why is this change being implemented now?</strong></p>
<p>BYU-Idaho has experienced, and expects to continue experiencing, significant growth in our enrollments.&nbsp; This growth has put significant pressure on the demand for these Gateway Foundations sections.&nbsp; Therefore, because these courses have been designed and intended for freshmen, we have recognized the need to help freshmen get these courses during their freshman semesters.</p>
<p><strong><img name="faq4" />What courses are impacted by this change in registration?</strong></p>
<p>Winter 2013 registration will change for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DAY sections</span> only of the four Gateway Foundations courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>FDAMF 101</li>
<li>FDENG 101</li>
<li>FDMAT 108</li>
<li>FDSCI 101</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img name="faq5" />Is there a limit to the number of Foundations Gateway sections for which I can register?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; From November 21 through December 11, all students will be limited to registration in only two DAY sections of these courses, but will have unlimited access to online sections of these courses.&nbsp; Beginning Wednesday, December 12, the registration limit of two will be lifted, and students will be able to register in the DAY sections of all four courses if needed and if seats are available.</p>
<p><strong><img name="faq6" />How do I know if I qualify as a new or second-semester freshman?</strong></p>
<p>New freshmen have been identified as students for whom Winter 2013 will be their first semester of enrollment at BYU-Idaho and who have earned less than 30 college credits.</p>
<p>Second-semester freshmen have been identified as students who have attempted less than 21 credits at BYU-Idaho and who have earned less than 30 college credits.</p>
<p><strong><img name="faq7" />I am a new freshman or a second-semester freshman, and registration opens for me prior to November 21.&nbsp; Why can't I add these classes on my first priority registration date?</strong></p>
<p>To be fair...</p>
<p><strong><img name="faq8" />I am not a freshman but still need to take these classes.&nbsp; What do I do now?</strong></p>
<p>Non-freshmen who have not yet completed one or more of the Gateway Foundations courses will have unlimited priority access to online sections of these courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning Wednesday, December 5, non-freshmen will be given access to register for a maximum of two Day sections of the Gateway Foundations courses.&nbsp; Additionally, on December 12, the registration limit of two courses will be lifted, and all students will be able to add additional DAY sections of these courses, if available.</p>
<p><strong><img name="faq9" />I am a transfer student; does this change apply to me?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; If Winter 2013 is the first semester you will be attending BYU-Idaho and you are transferring in less than 30 college credits (including AP), you will be considered a new freshman and will be eligible to register for two DAY sections of the Gateway Foundations courses beginning November 21.&nbsp; However, if you transfer in more than 30 college credits, you will be eligible to register with the other non-freshmen on the dates indicated.</p>
<p><strong><img name="faq10" />I am an online student; how does this change impact me?</strong></p>
<p>Online students will not be impacted by this change because they register for ONLN sections of the Gateway Foundations courses.&nbsp; The change applies only to DAY sections, for which online students are not eligible.</p>
<p><strong><img name="faq11" />Can an instructor authorize me to add more than two of these Gateway Foundations courses?</strong></p>
<p>No.&nbsp; Instructors cannot override the registration limit of Gateway Foundations courses, nor can they authorize you to register before your assigned registration date.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><img name="faq12" />How important is it that I take these Gateway Foundations courses as a freshman?</strong></p>
<p>It is very important for freshmen to take the four Gateway Foundations courses in their first few semesters in order for the sequencing of subsequent semesters to not be impacted negatively. &nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, freshmen are strongly encouraged to take advantage of their ability to register for these courses before other students on campus have access to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img name="faq13" />Can I add myself to a waitlist for these courses?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; The waitlist for the Gateway Foundations courses will function the same as the waitlist for any other course. However, students may only be registered and waitlisted for a maximum of two Gateway Foundations courses at any time.&nbsp; For example, students may register for one and waitlist one Gateway Foundations section, but may not register for two sections <em>and</em> waitlist a third.</p>

<p><strong>Is there someone I can contact if I have any further question?</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Please email any questions you may have to <a href="https://sn2prd0102.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=ygXIMh8Xr0iQcjn3zLbNUiuKJNJahs8Igu23-87XUdeBcHXKHnDpv_nxG35cLsDYuqwVSpjBAsE.&amp;URL=mailto%3aregistration%40byui.edu" target="_blank">registration@byui.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></BodyCopy><xPower Type="GroupStart" GroupStart="" Name="PageComponents" label="Page Components" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded=""><xPower Type="List" List="xpowercomponent_Optional" Name="OptionalColumnComponent" label="Optional Column Components" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="FacebookComponent;Image;ColumnTextComponent;Media;Quote" Expanded="false"><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="Optional" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="FacebookComponent;Image;ColumnTextComponent;Media;Quote" Expanded="false"/></xPower><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="QuickLinksColumn1" label="QuickLinks Column 1" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="QuickLinksComponent"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="QuickLinksColumn2" label="QuickLinks Column 2" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="QuickLinksComponent"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="QuickLinksColumn3" label="QuickLinks Column 3" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="QuickLinksComponent"/></xPower><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Navigation" StartPage="x5" MaxDepth="" MaxNodes="" GenerationOrder="down" Navigation="Ancestors" Query="" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="x44655" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="SiteControl" Expanded="false"/></Content>
