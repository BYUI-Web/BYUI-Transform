<p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong>Beginning January 1, 2014, approved exercise clothing will no longer be available for checkout at the Hart Building. The $15 laundry service that has been offered in conjunction with checking out clothing will also be discontinued at that time. Towel service will continue to be provided for free in our facilities. <br />Approved exercise clothing will still be required in the Hart Building and the BYU-Idaho Center courts. As before, clothing can be purchased at the University Store. If you forget to bring approved clothing with you to campus, some clothing will remain on hand and will be available at the Hart Building Equipment Room for a $3 fee. <br />The age requirement for children to wear approved clothing has been raised to 8 years old. Approved issue is not required for the swimming pool, but swimsuits must follow the approved guidelines (<a href="http://www.byui.edu/activities/resources/exercise-facilities-and-play-fields/hart-building/swimming-and-exercise-clothing-rules">Click here for Swimsuit Policy</a>)<br />Discounts on approved exercise clothing may be available during University Store sales.</p>
