<h3>Combined Fair</h3>
<p>The Discovery Fair provides students with opportunities to seek jobs, internships, careers and graduate school information all in one place! With over 16,000 students on campus in fall 2012, we anticipate many will be in attendance making plans for their futures. <br /><br /></p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>At the heart of campus, the BYU-Idaho Center is Brigham Young University-Idaho&rsquo;s newest and largest building. The 435,000-square-foot building, containing a 15,000-seat auditorium and a multi-purpose area large enough for 10 full basketball courts, opened following a dedication on Dec 17, 2010.<br /><br /> Tours of this new facility will be available during Career Week.
