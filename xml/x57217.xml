<p>Come prepared with:<br /> Specific questions or concerns about the assignment.<br /> Hard copy of the assignment.<br /> Willingness to make changes.<br /> Twenty to thirty minutes to spend in a session.<br /> Enough time before assignment is due to make change<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Does my paper have to be for a class?</h3>
<p>No. The BYU-Idaho Writing Center works with resumes, cover letters, letters of introduction (for student teaching and graduate school applications) as well as creative works.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Can you guarantee me an "A"?</h3>
<p>No. The Writing Center can work with students to help their assignment meet the guidelines, but&nbsp;the Tutors cannot guarantee and "A".&nbsp;<br /> <br /></p>
<h3>What if a tutor gives me advice that I or my teacher disagree with?</h3>
<p>Writing tutors are your peers--fellow college students with experience in writing college papers. Because tutors are not familiar with the specifics of your assignment or your instructor's particular expectations, their comments should be understood only as&nbsp;<em>suggestions</em>. Always defer to the advice of your instructor and remember that the paper is yours; you must take responsibility for the suggested revisions you choose to incorporate in your final draft.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>How long are sessions?</h3>
<p>On average, session are around twenty minutes.&nbsp;This does not mean that for quick concerns students will be required to stay there for the full twenty minutes, or that students with many questions will be cut off after twenty minutes. International students on average have thirty to forty-five minute sessions, in order to address and concerns with the language itself.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>How much time before the due date should I come in?</h3>
<p>At least a few hours before class, but preferably at least a day or two in advance. This allows the student plenty of time to be able to correct or change any parts of their assignment that were worked on, as well as allowing enough time for the student to make any further changes or ask their teacher questions regarding the assignment.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Can I request an online session if I'm on-campus?</h3>
<p>No. Since on-campus students are able to come in to the Writing Center in person whereas off-campus students are not, the online sessions are strictly for those who are off-campus.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Where are you located?</h3>
<p>On the second floor of the McKay Library, near the Reading Center and Tutoring Center.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Is the BYU-Idaho Writing Center part of the Tutoring Center?</h3>
<p>No. Although the Writing Center does Tutor, we are partly a drop-in service as well. This means that not all students need to make an appointment. At the Tutoring Center most subject areas require that the student makes an appointment first.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Are all the employees at the BYU-Idaho Writing Center English majors?</h3>
<p>No. Some of the employees are, but others are Biology, Political Science, Health Administration, or Sociology majors. Being an English major is not required to work at the Writing Center.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>My teacher is requiring or giving extra credit for my visit. How will he or she know I have visited?</h3>
<p>We will stamp your draft or provide a kind of receipt, whichever you prefer. However, do not come with the attitude of "I'm just here to get my points." In order for us to provide evidence of your visit, you must visit at least 6 hours before the paper is due AND come with a draft copy (not the final copy you plan to turn in). If you come with your final copy, it will be obvious you have no intention of making changes, and therefore you visit is pointless.</p>]]></BodyCopy><xPower Type="GroupStart" GroupStart="" Name="PageComponents" label="Page Components" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded=""><xPower Type="List" List="xpowercomponent_Optional" Name="OptionalColumnComponent" label="Optional Column Components" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="FacebookComponent;Image;ColumnTextComponent;Media;Quote" Expanded="false"><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="Optional" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="FacebookComponent;Image;ColumnTextComponent;Media;Quote" Expanded="false"/></xPower><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="QuickLinksColumn1" label="QuickLinks Column 1" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="QuickLinksComponent"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="QuickLinksColumn2" label="QuickLinks Column 2" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="QuickLinksComponent"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="QuickLinksColumn3" label="QuickLinks Column 3" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="QuickLinksComponent"/></xPower><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Navigation" StartPage="x5" MaxDepth="" MaxNodes="" GenerationOrder="down" Navigation="Ancestors" Query="" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="x25860" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="SiteControl" Expanded="false"/></Content>
