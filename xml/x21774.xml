<p><span><span style="font-size: small;"> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">I happened upon a teaching method several years ago that continues to bear great dividends in my teaching. <span style="display: inline;">I was teaching a Scenic Painting for Theatre class and happened to have a student enrolled from the Interior Design Department. </span><span style="display: inline;">She had set very high expectations for herself. </span><span style="display: inline;">I would describe her as being a perfectionist. </span><span style="display: inline;">On one occasion early in the semester, she was struggling with an assignment. </span><span style="display: inline;">She was so frustrated that she had just about given up. </span><span style="display: inline;">She had put down her paintbrush, found a chair, sat down and cried. </span><span style="display: inline;">When I went to speak to her, she cried and told me that she had decided that she would never get it and that she might as well quit. </span><span style="display: inline;">As I was talking to her I suddenly remembered a principle I had learned in a training seminar at least fifteen years earlier so I said, “I give you permission to fail this assignment!” </span><span style="display: inline;">I don’t think anyone had ever spoken to her like that before and she looked at me as if I were insane, so I clarified, “I give you permission to fail this project with no harm to your grade if you admit to yourself you have botched it and then get back up and paint for the rest of the time with reckless abandon! </span><span style="display: inline;">You will not fail regardless of the result.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">I’m not sure she believed me at first, but I assured her that my word was good. To her credit, she accepted the deal and painted for the rest of the time with gusto. With the pressure to succeed gone, she ended up salvaging the project and actually turned in a very good piece of work.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">In the training seminar I attended so many years ago, the speaker had talked about learning by failure. It is a discipline our children understand but we as adults seem to have forgotten it. He talked about how children learn. He asked, “How does a child learn to walk? By falling down a whole bunch of times. He then posed a great question: <span style="display: inline;">'</span>When a child falls down does he wallow in despair and cry, 'I’ll never learn to walk'? No. They get up and try again and again and again. Eventually they succeed." <span style="display: inline;">Jazz musicians understand this principle as well. </span><span style="display: inline;">I’ve heard one play a wrong note during a solo and bend it ‘til it’s right, or make something else wonderful out of it. </span><span style="display: inline;">I have found over the years that students who are willing to fail in a grand way learn more and better than the students who succeed only tentatively, incrementally --never stretching significantly past their comfort zone, never testing their limits. </span><span style="display: inline;">The student who is willing to fail big will eventually succeed big, and what is more they learn how to succeed. </span><span style="display: inline;">Perhaps the ‘old wives’ knew a thing or two when they said, “If at first you don’t succeed…”</span></span></p>
