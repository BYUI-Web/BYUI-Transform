All clinical experiences are to be approved by faculty. Thirty-six (36) hours are deducted from the 96, giving credit for 1) orientation time at the individual health care facilities; 2) organization time fulfilling preceptor agreements; 3) previous learning. At least 50% or 30 hours is required in an adult ICU. The other 50% may be in ER, NICU, or ICU areas. If the student holds CCRN certification up to 50% of the clinical may be waived. The student will work closely with the instructor to choose an area of clinical experience to be arranged through a preceptor.]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
