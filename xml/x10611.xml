<div>
<p>Each season begins with mandatory registration meetings where&nbsp;participants are made aware of the risks of playing and verify they are willing to assume those risks. After all pre-participation requirements are met including: a physical, attendance at the registration meeting, assumption of risk form signed, insurance verification forms, and eligibility requirements, then participants may tryout out for teams.</p>
<p>Each player must provide their own cleats and mouth piece and optional pads, but all other required equipment will be available to be checked out from the Sports Issue Room&nbsp;upon being drafted to a team. Players can expect to pay a $30 participation fee,&nbsp;and $20 for a spirit pack which includes a t-shirt, socks and belt.</p>
<h2><strong>Physicals</strong></h2>
<p>Each player must&nbsp;submit a recent (within 1 year) physical on the required <a href="http://activities.byui.edu/Sports/competitive/football/forms/physical_examination.doc" target="_self">form</a> as well as a <a href="http://activities.byui.edu/Sports/competitive/football/forms/student_health_history.doc" target="_self">health history form</a>. Players may complete this physical at the BYU-Idaho Student Health Center or off campus. The Student Health Center will have one special walk-in time set aside for football players to complete their physicals Physical cost $10 for students or spouses with the Student Health Plan and $20 for students or spouses without the Student Health Plan. Walk-ins are first come first served. If at all possible call the Student Health Center (208) 496-9330&nbsp;and set up an appointment outside of the time set up for walk-in physicals. All players must have their physicals completed and turned in to the Activities Office in MC 101 by 6:00 pm Tuesday, September 20th.</p>
<h2><strong>Draft</strong></h2>
<p>Players that have successfully completed all the pre-participation requirements and all three tryout dates are eligible to be drafted into the league. The draft helps to create parity between the teams in the league. All players must be in attendance to be drafted. Not all those who are eligible will necessarily be drafted. To ensure an equitable draft players should be available for all three practice times in their entirety. However, a player may be drafted so long as they are available to&nbsp;attend&nbsp;at least one of the&nbsp;practice times&nbsp;in its&nbsp;entirety.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Team Combine/Relay Competition and Equipment Issue Day</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Football is highly dependent on players working together as team. A blown assignment can mean not only giving up yards, but can result in injuries. A team combine or competition will help to facilitate the team process. Preliminary activities will be team building and ice breaking, moving on to physical competitions and relays.</p>
<p>Following the combine, players will be issued their equipment: helmet shoulder pads, knee pads, thigh pads, tail pad, practice pants, practice jersey, socks, and belt. Additionally there are limited quantities of elbow pads, spider pads, flak jackets, and cowboy collars.</p>
<p><strong>Practices</strong></p>
<p>Practices take place on the stadium field. Players will be issued practice uniforms in the Sports Issue Room Hart 185. Additionally some teams may have walk -through practices and watch game film on other days of the week.</p>
