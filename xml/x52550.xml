Walker of the First Quorum of the Seventy in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints taught Brigham Young University-Idaho students to follow the example of President Thomas S. Monson's devotion to the Lord, the Church, and his family in Tuesday's weekly devotional address.</p>
<p><br /> Elder Walker shared several stories demonstrating President Monson's devotion to his Church callings, including his call at age 32 to be a mission president in Canada. Quoting President Monson, Elder Walker said, "I hadn't been a missionary. I'd received no preparatory training for this important calling. I was young. I needed the help of the Lord. I went out behind the mission home and found a secluded spot in the trees where I could pray. I included in my prayer: I'll not be a quitter. I'll give it everything I've got."</p>
<p><br /> Elder Walker told the students that President Monson's love and devotion to his wife, Frances, is evident, and that their 61-year marriage should be an example to them. "President Monson often mentions how supportive she has been. As he has gone about doing his duty and serving the Lord, he says he has &lsquo;never heard a word of complaint' from Sister Monson," Elder Walker said.</p>
<p><br />Another way the prophet is an example, Elder Walker said, is through his "cheery countenance" and "perfect brightness of hope." "I've been in meetings where very serious matters were being discussed, when President Monson paused to share a delightful story," he said. "I noticed that his telling of the story seemed to help all to keep their balance. This ability to see the humor even in difficult situations gives him a unique capacity to not overreact, to keep things in proper perspective and to keep things in balance. We could all learn from this."</p>
<p><br />To close his remarks, Elder Walker expressed his love for the prophet. "I truly love and admire President Monson and declare to you that his entire life and ministry are remarkable and wonderful and worthy of our emulation," he said. "May we follow the example of the prophet of God, Thomas S. Monson."</p>]]></BodyCopy><xPower Type="Component" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent"/><xPower Type="Component" Name="News" label="News" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="x28" CompTypes="NewsNavigationComponent"/><xPower Type="List" Name="ContentSnippet" label="Content Snippet" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="" List=""><xPower Type="Component" Name="xPower" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes=""/></xPower><xPower Type="Navigation" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false" Navigation="Ancestors" GenerationOrder="down" StartPage="x5" MaxNodes="" MaxDepth="" Query=""/><xPower Type="Component" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Component="x10257" CompTypes="SiteControl"/></NewsDetail>
