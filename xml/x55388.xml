Students who will, or may begin missionary service prior to attending BYU-Idaho are encouraged to complete and submit all Admission&nbsp;and Scholarship application materials before leaving on a mission. (see directions at left)<br /><br />In many cases, music scholarships will be awarded at the time of application and then automatically deferred until after missionary service. If a music scholarship is not awarded at the time of application, the scholarship application may be reconsidered at the time of the student's return and enrollment at BYU-Idaho. Such individuals will need to notify the Department of Music at least four months before their anticipated start date at BYU-Idaho to request reconsideration of their music scholarship application.</p>
