<p>This past July, I was one of five faculty members who attended the 31<sup>st</sup> International Conference on Critical Thinking in Berkeley, California.&nbsp; The other faculty members attending were from the physics, religion, communications, and chemistry departments.&nbsp; My experience attending the conference was beneficial not only because of what I learned, but also because of the relationships I forged with other faculty members from across campus.</p>
<p>While attending the critical thinking conference, I heard a fabulous story from another conference participant who teaches in the automotive department at a community college in Alberta, Canada.&nbsp; During a lunchtime conversation he shared the story of a student who was learning to patch a tire.&nbsp; The automotive shop at the college had tires mounted on rims, attached to the wall that were intended to be used by students to practice patching a tire.&nbsp; A student would remove a tire from the rim, drill a hole in it (so that they would have a hole to repair), and then patch the hole and remount the tire.&nbsp; This particular student had finished the training, had demonstrated proficiency in all of the steps, and was very capable of repairing a hole in a tire.&nbsp; One day, he asked if he could bring in his personal vehicle and use the shop to repair a leak in his tire.&nbsp; The teacher agreed.&nbsp; The student brought in the car, raised it on the lift, removed the tire, and then proceeded to drill a hole in his tire.&nbsp; It was clear that the student knew the process of repairing a tire, but didn't have any idea <em>why</em> the process worked.</p>
<p>As a math teacher I think my students often approach solving a math problem by "drilling a hole in it".&nbsp; They learn all the steps to some mathematical process and show they are able to follow all of the steps.&nbsp; But then in a different context, they use that technique without making sure they understand whether the technique is appropriate for that situation.&nbsp; For example, students learn that 2x / 2 = x, so they incorrectly assume that 2x + 1 / 2 = x + 1.&nbsp;I want to encourage my students to think critically about a mathematical process.&nbsp; I want them to understand why it works.&nbsp; When they understand why it works they will better understand when it is appropriate to use that method in other contexts.&nbsp; At the critical thinking conference I gained a few ideas about how to help my students think critically.&nbsp; I have been working with my students on "critical reading".&nbsp; Using techniques I learned at the conference, I am trying to help them carefully read each sentence of a given passage, paraphrase it, and elaborate on it before they move on to the next sentence.&nbsp; I am also encouraging metacognition skills with my students.&nbsp; <em>Metacognition</em> is defined as the process of thinking about your thinking process.&nbsp; I hope that as my students consciously make an effort to think about the process of their thinking, they will learn to better recognize when they don't understand the concept behind a mathematical process.&nbsp; Recognizing when they don't understand a concept helps them avoid "drilling a hole" by applying the concept incorrectly.</p>
<p>I love attending conferences because they give me the opportunity to think critically about my teaching.&nbsp; I return excited and encouraged to improve and try something new.&nbsp; I hope I am never guilty of "drilling a hole" in my instructional methods.&nbsp; I hope I don't choose to teach a particular way just because that is how I have always done it.&nbsp; I appreciate the opportunity that attending a conference gives me to step back and examine my teaching from a new viewpoint.</p>
