If the instructor is located in Utah or Idaho they can  access their payroll notification through the BYU-Idaho Payroll  Notification site by clicking on the following link: <a href="http://web.byui.edu/payroll/notify">http://web.byui.edu/payroll/notify</a> and entering their NetID and password. Instructors who are not living  in Utah or Idaho are paid through CORT. For those employees, DMBA  creates a DMBA ID number for each and BYU-Idaho human resources then  sends them an email with specific instructions on how to review  paystubs. Additional details will be posted here soon.]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
