<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="display: inline;"><strong style="display: inline !important;">&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="display: inline;">Sam is an interesting case in that he didn&rsquo;t start out as an outstanding student, but over time he transformed himself into one of my best.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">It&rsquo;s one thing to be a good student.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">It&rsquo;s quite another thing (and perhaps more impressive) to become a good student.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">A teacher who has experienced this process first hand will be a real asset to his school and to his students, since this is what teaching is all about.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span style="display: inline;">In the first course he took from me (Spanish 339-Introduction to Literary Analysis), Sam was about average, earning a B-.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">He enrolled in another course (Spanish 441-Masterpieces of Spanish Literature) the following semester, wherein he did very little, had a lot of absences and effectively withdrew from the course.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">I believe I gave him a D.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">Making no excuses, Sam admitted that he should have done better, and he vowed to improve the next time around.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">Retaking SPAN 441, Sam had perfect attendance, was always prepared for class, and was one of the most proactive students in terms of participation.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">In the course of our discussions of the literary readings I was repeatedly impressed with his attention to detail and the quality and depth of his insights.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">He ended up with an unequivocal A in the course.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">He was cheerful, enthusiastic, and highly motivated, not for the sake of a grade, evidently, but truly to learn.&nbsp;</span><span style="display: inline;">Somehow he had come to terms with his shortcomings and turned them into strengths.</span></span></p>
