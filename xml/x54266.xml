<p><strong>What was the hardest part of the UVM &nbsp;program?<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">I would say the hardest part of the UVM program was the fact that they don't have as much homework. &nbsp;Meaning you aren't graded on your homework so your grade is exactly what you get on the tests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />If an interested student were to ask you if you would recommend the UVM program, what would you say?<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">I would definitely say yes! They should do it! It is loads of fun, you learn lots of Spanish, and you really get to learn about a unique culture. &nbsp;I would also say bring lots of extra money so they can participate in the things the school had to offer (such as horseback riding on the beach, doing the high ropes course, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />What do you wish you had known before you went to Chile?<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">I wish I had known that they mainly rely on using cash there. &nbsp;Very few places take credit cards and such so plan on bringing pretty much only cash! Also, if there are any foods you feel like you can't live without for a few months I would bring them down with you. &nbsp;Another thing that was shocking to me as we went down there is that they were in winter/spring and so it was colder than I thought it would be until late October/ early November. &nbsp;This means you should plan on packing some sweatshirts and jackets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />Do you have any financial tips for interested students?<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Bring lots of cash! They don't accept cards like we do up here so don't count on that. &nbsp;Also I would recommend bringing lots of extra money for travelling, this was really popular among all of the international students and you'll feel like you're really missing out if you don't join!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />How did you survive the long flights?<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Piece of cake, sleep. &nbsp;I would recommend bringing some books, music, and snacks for the plane but mostly just try and sleep and that will get you through it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />What would you do differently if you could do it again?<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Bring more money so that I could travel more. &nbsp;I did end up going to Argentina, but I have heard that the south of Chile is beautiful- every Chilean says so. &nbsp;If you get a chance, travel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />What was the best thing about the program in Vi&ntilde;a?<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">You get to experience the culture by living with a host family and you learn lots. &nbsp;I would recommend living with someone that speaks little to no English so that you can improve your Spanish. &nbsp;But I would say the best thing was probably meeting all the wonderful people there and getting involved with JAS (Jovenes Adultos Solteros- basically young single adults) at church.</li>
</ul>
