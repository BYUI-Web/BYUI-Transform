<p align="center"><strong>My Grandfather Starts a Dry Farm </strong></p>
<p align="center">Ellen Bunker</p>
<p><em>Laron Bates, my grandfather, moved 100 years ago to the place in Arizona where I was born. For me, this is an anniversary year. I want to remember him making that move one hundred years ago. My grandfather got a job from the University of Arizona. That was in 1911. He was going to try and run a "dry farm." A dry farm is a farm where you use only rainwater for your plants. In many parts of the world, this is a common way to farm. But Arizona is a desert and it does not rain very much. This farm was a test, or an experiment. They called it the experimental dry farm. My grandfather planted his crops. The main crop was corn. The first few years of the experiment, the crops grew very well. We have pictures of him standing in the corn where the plants had grown over his head. But later on a dry year came and the crops failed. This was followed by another dry year and the crops failed again. This happened three years in a row. At last, the university decided that they did not want to continue the experiment. They decided it was not a good idea to try and have dry farms in the desert in Arizona. Instead, people had to use water from lakes and rivers for their crops. They had to build ditches, or places for the water to run to the farm land. Although my grandfather still got paid from the university during these last three years when the crops failed, at the end he was out of a job. He had to find a new place to work. He moved to my hometown and began to farm again, but this time he helped build a water system. Then he could farm. He was able to raise his family, start a branch of the Church, and build up a new community. I'm glad my grandfather was willing to try an experiment. Even though the dry farm failed, my grandfather and grandmother made a good life for our family in this new area in Arizona.</em></p>
