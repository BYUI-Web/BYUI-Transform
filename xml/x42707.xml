If you forgot or missed your appointment, send an email to your partner to apologize for missing the session; if you are participating as part of a course assignment, you will have to forfeit the points for failing to show up. If it was your partner who missed the appointment, you are not obligated to meet again that week; however, if you are participating as part of a course assignment, refer to your instructor or syllabus for instructions on completing a reserve or alternative assignment for that week.</p>]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
