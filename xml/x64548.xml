This is an opportunity for the student to interact in and improve their English as well as to learn about the culture. If you do know the student&rsquo;s first language, please do not use that language to explain English vocabulary or grammar concepts. By pushing the student to use only English to try to communicate or work through difficulties, the students will improve their language skills.]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
