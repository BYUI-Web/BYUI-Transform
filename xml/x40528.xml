</ul>
<strong>What is the Verification process?</strong>
<ul>
<li>At BYU-Idaho, the Financial Aid Office is required by federal regulations to verify student's files. This means those who are randomly selected will be required to submit further documents to our office before we can process an award. <a href="http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid/federal-aid">Click here for more information</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>How do I know if I am selected for Verification?</strong>

These will need to be submitted before we can continue processing your financial aid award. <a href="http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid/federal-aid"> Click here for more information</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>What is the difference between the different loans?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stafford Loans are a series of fixed-rate student loans for undergraduate and graduate students attending college at least half-time (six credits or more). Students are considered for these loan offers based on the FAFSA.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Direct Subsidized Loan: The Direct Subsidized Loan has a 3.86% APR interest rate and the federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school. Principle and Interest payments are postponed while students are enrolled in at least six credits and during their grace period.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Direct Unsubsidized Loan: The Direct Unsubsidized Loan has a 3.86% APR interest rate and the student responsible for the accrued interest while they are in school. Principle payments are postponed while students are enrolled in at least six credits and during their grace period.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Plus Loan: A Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) is a federal guaranteed loan and is available for a parent of dependent undergraduate students. The parent may borrow up to the student's annual cost of attendance minus any financial assistance the student has been or will be awarded during the period of enrollment. The Parent Loan has a 6.41% APR interest rate and repayment begins within 60 days after the loan has been fully disbursed. Interest begins to accumulate at the time the first disbursement is made (on the first semester amount only until the second half is disbursed). Students and Parents will need to re-apply every academic year for the loan.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid/federal-aid"> Click here for more information</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>What is the Grace Period?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Grace period is where students are not required to start repayment until six months after dropping below six credits. If a student defers a semester and is below six credits for more than six months, repayment will start and their grace period will have been used up.</li>

<ul>
<li>Financial aid awards (scholarships, grants and/or loans) are disbursed within the first week of the semester if the student has completed all of the requirements by the priority deadline. Occasionally, some financial aid awards will be disbursed earlier or later than others. However, there is no guarantee date for disbursement.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How do I know if my financial aid is available to me?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Financial aid award funds are released into a student's Personal Account. You can find your personal account summary by logging into my.byui.edu; click on the finance tab; click on Personal Account Summary. Any funds released to your account will show under the heading 'Available and Disbursed Financial Aid/Scholarships.'

Amounts listed in green are available to the student.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How can I use financial aid funds?</strong>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Financial aid funds are intended to be used for education costs. Initially, your financial aid should be used first to cover your tuition costs and any tuition (class) based fees. Remaining financial aid funds can then be used to pay off any outstanding school balances, books, school supplies, and any living expense you incur while completing your education, such as: housing, travel expenses, insurance, and food expenses.</li>
<li>Please note, certain financial aid awards, such as some private scholarships, have requirements limiting their use only for tuition based costs.</li>
