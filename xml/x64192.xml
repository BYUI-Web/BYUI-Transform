<p>The Faculty Development Committee sponsored two panel discussions  on the fifth principle of the Learning Model: &ldquo;Learners and teachers at  BYU-Idaho love, serve, and teach one another&rdquo; on February 12 and 13.&nbsp; Afterwards, participants were asked to  reflect on what they learned.&nbsp; I have  summarized these reflections around major themes.&nbsp; Three of these themes are included in this  article.&nbsp; Additional comments about the  panel discussions posted in a previous Faculty Voices article.</p>

<p><strong>Ideas for First Days</strong></p>

<p>I like the idea of using unusual questions for the "get to know  each other" segment of the first day.</p>
<p><em>Nancy Hayes &mdash; English</em></p>
<br />
<p>I learned that pondering and thinking  about how to frame the course during the first class can set an atmosphere of  caring and concern and help students break down the barriers that may hinder  their learning.</p>
<p><em>Susan Garbett &mdash; Nursing</em></p>
<br />
<p>I plan to  go &ldquo;swimming.&rdquo;  I doubt I will ever drag my class down to the pool, but I  am going to explore more creative ways to introduce the subject and tear down  barriers on the first day of class.</p>

<p><strong>Working with &ldquo;Failure&rdquo;</strong></p>
<br />
<p>One of the major obstacles I have to  overcome in order to achieve true learning and teaching is the idea of the &ldquo;right&rdquo; answer.  Instead of just memorizing what is &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;,  we need to (as a class) seek to understand the reasons, observations, or  research that supports why statements, ideas, or theories are generally  accepted.</p>
<p><em>Kory W. Godfrey &mdash; Computer Information  Technology</em></p>
<br />
<p>I learned the importance of valuing  "wrong" answers from students.  This is not to say  that I should encourage students&nbsp;<span style="display: inline;"><em style="display: inline !important;">not&nbsp;</em></span>to master a given subject; rather, as students  are striving to comprehend, internalize, and apply principles with  which they may be relatively unfamiliar or inexperienced, I should  help them feel safe in communicating their understanding of the things they are  learning, even if that understanding is not yet fully developed.</p>

<p><em>Shawn Dorman &mdash; Religion</em></p>
<br />
<p>We should try to find what is right about a student&rsquo;s wrong answer.</p>
<p><em>David Collins &mdash; Chemistry</em></p>
<br />
<p>We should practice what we preach and not be afraid of failures in our teaching ideas &mdash; some will go well, others won&rsquo;t.  My father used to say, &ldquo;You win or  you learn&mdash;you never fail.&rdquo;  This is as true with us as it is with our  students.</p>
<p><em>Ed Kumferman &mdash; Foreign Languages and Literatures</em></p>
<br />
<p><strong>Teachers as Learners</strong></p>
<br />
<p>Our teaching is energized &mdash; which blesses our  students&mdash;when teachers have opportunities to learn from one another.</p>

<p>Daniel Baird&rsquo;s comments about not getting caught up in the method itself but  constantly searching for the principles involved reminded me of the importance  of seeking and developing the gift of discernment.</p>
<p><em>Ed Kumferman &mdash; Foreign Languages and Literatures</em></p>
<br />
<p>The greatest learning I came to after the brown bag discussion was that I love to  learn from others!  As I listened to the examples shared, I thought to  myself, I can do that.  I really like to hear how the same technique is  used in different disciplines.</p>
<p><em>Lynda Hawkes &mdash; Teacher Education</em></p>
<br />
<p>I enjoyed the ideas that were shared,  but I especially appreciated being reminded that it is not just about copying  my colleagues&rsquo; great teaching ideas but the personal process of seeking  improvement in my own teaching practice. Whether I need to build a greater  degree of trust with my students or create a safer and more motivating environment,  I need to rely on the Spirit as I continually seek ideas that will best serve  my current students.</p>
