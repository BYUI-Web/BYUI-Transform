After a few years and a lot of hard work, Brother Gardner developed a program that made this baccalaureate degree available to the campus students at BYU-Idaho. Shortly after that task was complete, he was approached about creating a course of study that would allow for this degree to be available online. Brother Gardner had this to say about building this online degree: "It's a difficult and timely process to create each course offered online, a couple of semesters at least for each course. But, as the technology catches up, we see the courses becoming better and better. In fact we are pretty much at a point where our online courses are as good as our face to face courses."&nbsp;</span><br /><br /> &nbsp; When asked what Brother Gardner's motivating force was behind developing this program he referred to the mandate found in the proclamation on the family which states "We call upon&nbsp;responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society."&nbsp; Brother Gardner further clarifies this impelling cause, "The Marriage and Family Studies degree certainly does what the mandate states. If we can train more people to go out into the world to help others have strong families, at that grass roots level- there is nothing better. Marriage and family is the Lord's work and glory. Being able to offer this degree online is a great blessing to many people. We see students through the Online Degree and Pathway programs being blessed throughout the world as they study about the most important work on earth but participate in this work that extends throughout eternity." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Purposefully calling the major Marriage and Family Studies as other universities remove marriage &nbsp;studies from their curriculum, helps BYU-Idaho graduates to stand out as experts in their field. Brother Gardner found that other universities do not require even one class on marriage or parenting in their course work. "How can you be a family professional without having had those classes? questioned Gardner. He goes on to say, "You can see how BYU-Idaho students are more prepared, for two reasons. First, we do have a marriage and parenting focus. We offer separate, more in-depth training than other graduates from other universities around the country. Second, other universities offer a combined Human Development/Family Studies Degree, which is nice and broad."</p>
<p>BYU-Idaho's Marriage and Family program pushes the students to use their knowledge in very practical and vital ways. During the major's course of study, students are required to participate in a practicum course and to fulfill an internship within the field. These experiences are unique, very structured, and heavily supervised, but prepare the student well for real-life success.</p>
<p>When asked what type of work Brother Gardner sees his students doing upon graduation, he pulled out a book on careers within the field of family science published by the <em>National Council on Family Relations. </em>It contained a long list of jobs that a marriage and family graduate with a baccalaureate degree would be well prepared for. Jobs listed cover a wide variety of entry level positions within community, government, education and non-profit agencies. &nbsp;The average starting pay for positions in this field is usually around $30,000 annually. Specific jobs might include work in an adoption agency, as a psycho-social rehabilitation worker, or a case manager for children in treatment centers or with mental or emotional health issues. Other interesting positions that Brother Gardner's students have acquired include advocacy, educating Utah state legislature on family friendly laws, and creating programs for the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), and high schools on relationship education. Brother Gardner says there are many things that a student can do with a baccalaureate degree in marriage and family studies. The graduate may have to market him or herself, but there are definitely things that they can do. &nbsp;</p>]]></BodyCopy><xPower Type="Component" Component="x18360" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="News" label="News" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="NewsNavigationComponent" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="List" List="xpowercomponent_ContentSnippet" Name="ContentSnippet" label="Content Snippet" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="false" Component="" CompTypes="ContentSnippet"><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="ContentSnippet" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="false" CompTypes="ContentSnippet"/></xPower><xPower Type="Navigation" StartPage="x5" MaxDepth="" MaxNodes="" GenerationOrder="down" Navigation="Ancestors" Query="" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="x17147" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" CompTypes="SiteControl"/></NewsDetail>
