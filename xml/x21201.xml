<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Application</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">The majority of faculty (96%) perceive themselves as applying the Learning Model and see students (90%) as also applying it to lesser degrees.<span>&nbsp; </span>The graph below plots Likert scale responses to statements about faculty (blue) and student (red) application.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">While perceptions in both cases are positive, the degree of faculty and student application of the Learning Model varies.<span>&nbsp; </span>Faculty view themselves as making solid efforts, while noting that students lag behind in their application.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faculty Instruction</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">One of the open-ended questions of the survey asked faculty if the Learning Model has affected their instruction, and if so, how.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Faculty response is overwhelmingly positive with the occasional neutral or negative experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>The majority (86% of the comments) respond that it has affected their teaching positively (in varying degrees).<span>&nbsp; </span>The remaining (17%) note that it has not affected them. <span>&nbsp;</span>Of those not affected, most indicate that they had already integrated the principles of the Learning Model into their teaching before they were referred to as such.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">Two major themes emerge among faculty who note that the Learning Model has affected their instruction:<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<br /> 
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">A 	majority of faculty note that the Learning Model has caused them to 	&ldquo;rethink,&rdquo; &ldquo;restructure,&rdquo; or &ldquo;redo&rdquo; various aspects of their instruction.<span>&nbsp; </span>The model has therefore clearly become 	an impetus for reflection and change, and the tone of the comments 	indicates that the respondents found the change to be for the better.<span>&nbsp; </span>Faculty comments note not only changing 	instructional methods (the most common response), but highlight changes in 	the design of their courses, selection of their content, and structure of their 	syllabi.<span>&nbsp; </span>They also note the 	difficulties of managing these changes.<span>&nbsp; </span>As one faculty member writes &ldquo;in trying to follow the model and 	give more time for my students to be more involved in teach[ing], I&rsquo;ve had 	to streamline [content] in order to have time needed to implement the 	ponder and prove steps.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>Such caveats 	to otherwise positive comments are common throughout the responses, 	indicating that while the respondents see value in the model and give it 	strong positive assignments, they also see associated complexities and 	challenges in the application.</li>
<br />
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">Faculty 	comments also indicate that the &ldquo;rethinking&rdquo; instructors are experiencing is 	centered on student learning.<span>&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;It 	has helped me keep the focus &ndash; <span>&nbsp;</span>that 	[it] is not about us, it is about them (students).&rdquo; <span>&nbsp;</span>Another notes, &ldquo;I am more cognizant of 	having students involved in the learning process.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>These and other comments suggest that 	the framework of the Learning Model elicits an examination of instruction 	from a more student-centered perspective. Faculty gave various examples of 	reworking learning objectives, preparation assignments, classroom 	activities, etc. from a <em>learning</em> rather than <em>teaching</em> viewpoint. </li>
<br />
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">Faculty who report the Learning 	Model has not affected their instruction almost universally make comments such 	as &ldquo;much of the Learning Model concept was already in place in my instruction 	before it was ever introduced as such,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t something new or unique 	to BYU-Idaho; it&rsquo;s what good teachers do.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>The tone of these comments is varied from simply declarative and 	neutral, to frustration with the topic. </li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Student Application</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">Faculty perception of student response to the Learning Model is mixed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most faculty members note that while the student body is responding &ldquo;generally,&rdquo; &ldquo;for the most part,&rdquo; or &ldquo;mostly,&rdquo; in a positive manner, individual student responses vary widely.<span>&nbsp; </span>One faculty member described this stratification of students in terms of &ldquo;Celestial students,&rdquo; &ldquo;Terrestrial students,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Telestial students.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">In describing the reluctance of some students to take more responsibility for their learning, faculty made the following comments:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>&middot;<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;[Students] would still prefer to leave the burden of instruction to the teacher meaning they don&rsquo;t always prepare as thoughtfully and thoroughly as the course requires.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>&middot;<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&ldquo;Students prefer the easiest route and the Learning Model is not the easiest route, therefore they don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>&middot;<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&ldquo;My students have difficult[y] &lsquo;weaning themselves from the bottle&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">To counter this resistance faculty responded in various ways:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>&middot;<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&ldquo;They respond well if I am constantly reminding them of the process.&rdquo; (see <a href="http://web.byui.edu/learningandteaching/tools/Tool.aspx?ToolID=26">Teaching Your Class about the Learning Model</a>)</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>&middot;<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&ldquo;I have worked hard to transition the attitude of the learning from extrinsic to intrinsic.<span>&nbsp; </span>I find the when the motivation is intrinsic the response is more positive.&rdquo; (see <a href="http://web.byui.edu/learningandteaching/tools/Tool.aspx?ToolID=6">Developing Student&rsquo;s Intrinsic Motivation</a>)</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span>&middot;<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&ldquo;They will do what is right in this regard [apply the Learning Model] when all other possibilities have been exhausted.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin-bottom: 4pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 4pt;">Students are being asked to take more responsibility for their learning.<span>&nbsp; </span>While a few students may be reluctant, faculty members are optimistic that with time students will improve.<span>&nbsp; </span>It involves a &ldquo;cultural shift on campus.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>In this process of change students are improving as one instructor noted, &ldquo;with dutiful albeit sometimes reluctant acceptance.&rdquo; <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>]]></BodyCopy><xPower Type="Component" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent" /><xPower Type="Component" Name="News" label="News" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="NewsNavigationComponent" /><xPower Type="List" Name="ContentSnippet" label="Content Snippet" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="" List=""><xPower Type="Component" Name="xPower" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="" /></xPower><xPower Type="Navigation" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false" Navigation="Ancestors" GenerationOrder="down" StartPage="x5" MaxNodes="" MaxDepth="" Query="" /><xPower Type="Component" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Component="x19084" CompTypes="SiteControl" /></NewsDetail>
