Because the Book of Mormon describes events that happened hundreds of years ago, it can sometimes be challenging to see the men and women of those times as real people. Where did they live? What did they looked like? What kind of clothes did they wear? What were their houses and cities like? While there are no definitive answers to questions such as these, we will explore some tantalizing possibilities that can help us bridge the gulf between their lives and ours, to make their experiences more powerful (as well as more poignant) for us today.</td>
