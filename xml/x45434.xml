We do not always  know what to plan for or when so we plan for the worst and hope for the  best. We follow the advise given to us by the Prophets of old and today,  "If ye are prepared, ye shall not fear." (D&amp;C 38:3)</p>

<p><strong>Preparing for any Emergency</strong></p>
<p align="left">The Center for Disease Control has recently updated its  site for Emergency Preparedness and Response to include Health and  Safety Concerns for All Disasters.&nbsp; It is well worth the time to visit  this site often.&nbsp; <a href="http://emergency.cdc.gov/disasters/alldisasters.asp?s_cid=ccu060611_09" target="_self">Click here to go to the CDC site.</a></p>

<p><strong>Preparing for a Pandemic</strong></p>
<p align="left">Many people are concerned about what they can and should  do to prepare for the most recent potential medical emergency  threatening the world today. The Avian Flu. Though the time line of this  threat to our safety is not known we can and should prepare for it.  These preparations consist of being informed of what it is and what you  need to do. There are several sites that can be accessed to help you to  know what is happening.</p>
<p align="left">The main web site is: <a href="http://www.flu.gov/pandemic/index.html" target="_parent"><strong>www.flu.gov</strong></a> .</p>
<p align="left">BYU-Idaho is preparing by stockpiling a few materials  that we normally did not consider for other emergency situations, i.e.  N95 masks. We encourage all students, faculty, staff and visitors to  this site, to prepare by putting together a 72 or 96 hour kit that can  be accessed in the event of any emergency. A student kit need only be  the bare essentials and can cost less than $20. A list of what you  should have as a minimum can be found <a href="Documents/Admin_Offices/Facilities Management/Security and Safety/Student 72 Hour Kit.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Department Planning</strong></p>
<p align="left">The effectiveness of departmental emergency response       plans depends on planning and training performed before the emergency or disaster. If       supervisors support safety programs and disaster planning, employees will view the program       as worthwhile. The development of a written plan is vital to gain employee support. <br /> <br /> Departmental plans should be comprehensive enough to deal with all types of disasters,       including as a minimum, the following elements: escape procedures, pre-and post-       evacuation procedures, reporting procedures, and personnel emergency call lists. <br /> <br /> All employees should be trained and the plan updated annually or when a new employee is       hired; when new equipment, materials, or processes are introduced; when procedures are       updated or revised; or when routine drills show that employee performance must be       improved.</p>
