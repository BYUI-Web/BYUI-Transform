In other words, if an employer states that they require a bachelor's degree level of education (and don't specify a particular major - Accounting, Business, etc.) then this degree would meet those requirements. A number of employers only require Bachelor degree completion, and do not care what major, and for those, this is a valid option. When we state: "The online degree is a non-specialty degree, generally not intended for those planning to attend graduate school," we are only clarifying that it is a general subjects degree... and depending on the graduate school (business, education, etc.) the graduate school may require a specific bachelor's degree major, and we want to make sure students understand that this MAY not meet the requirements for SOME graduate programs. However, this degree does NOT limit someone from eventually attending graduate school at all... this is a valid Bachelor's degree ... the student would need to contact the desired graduate school(s) to see if this is acceptable for that particular graduate program. Just as with the employer requirements, we want to be sure students do the proper investigation to verify if this is a program that would work for them.<em> </em></p>]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
