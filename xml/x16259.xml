<p>All communication pieces need to have a logo which identifies the sponsoring office, college or program. Unless otherwise determined by the Communication Council, a logo should be used on all communication pieces.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: These logos can be downloaded by visiting the&nbsp;<a href="https://inet.byui.edu/sites/Identity/SitePages/Home.aspx">Identity Site on SharePoint</a>&nbsp;After entering your username and password, select the logo that matches your department or office.&nbsp;<em>(If you are a student, you currently have limited access to this site and will need the help of your supervisor.)</em></p>
