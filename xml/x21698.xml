<p>West Kearns Elementary School was built in1954 with later additions  finished by 1963 to meet the growing population of the neighborhood. For  many years the building housed two schools; an upper grade school and a  lower grade school with student populations as high as 1400 students!  As the residents in the area matured, the school has declined in  population and it is now one school administered by one principal.  However, it is still very large serving&nbsp;700 students and&nbsp;more than&nbsp;130  preschool students, including Head Start.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
