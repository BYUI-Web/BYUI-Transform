<ul>
<li><strong>Indigenous People in Chile</strong>&nbsp; = Spanish 350, Spanish 490R &nbsp;The Mapuche are the largest indigenous people in Chile and particularly significant in terms of Chile's culture and identity. However, our indigenous roots have been systematically denied by the country's dominant elites since the inception of Chile as a Nation State. Furthermore, Chilean society at large has remained either oblivious, ignorant or distant of their indigenous ancestry, considering the Mapuche, and everything related to them, as something of the past or, at the best, marginal. In fact, since the emergence of the Chilean Nation-State at the beginning of the XIX century, the elites have adopted and transmitted a Eurocentric view of themselves and of society as a whole and, therefore, also adopting a racist attitude and praxis which has had dire consequences for the country's indigenous peoples.&nbsp;It is within this general framework that this course seeks to analyze and understand the historical relationship between the State and the Mapuche from an interdisciplinary perspective. Thus, the course examines theories and concepts which will help the student to comprehend the current Mapuche movement and the State's reaction to the latter's visibilization and actions which challenge the present nature of a uninational State.</li>
