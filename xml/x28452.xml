Now of New York City, Hamilton is a former BYU-Idaho student.<br /><br />Osmond has music running through his veins, literally. He's the fourth son of Alan Osmond, oldest of the performing Osmond Brothers, and began performing as the lead singer with his own brothers when he was only four years old.<br /><br />They were known as The Osmond Boys and were discovered by the late Bob Hope, appearing on his 1986 Christmas show for their national television debut. By the 1980s, they evolved into The Osmonds 2nd Generation. Eventually as a group they settled in Branson, Mo., as featured performers at the Osmond Family Theater.<br /><br />David became his uncle Donny Osmond's understudy in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, actually taking over the lead role and continuing as Joseph in regional and national touring companies of the musical for many years.<br /><br />He was forced to put music on hold for several years, however, due to a physical battle with multiple sclerosis. He has passionately dedicated himself to raising awareness and resources for the MS community through speaking and performing nationwide with a hopeful and positive message of overcoming adversity. He was the 2010 recipient of The National MS Society's Spirit of Life Award.<br /><br />Recent improvements in his health have allowed him to place his focus back on music. He was featured on American Idol in 2009, he reprised the role of Joseph at the CLO theater in Pittsburgh, and also had the chance to recently perform alongside artists such as David Archuleta, Take 6, The Jonas Brothers, Michelle Branch, and The Eagles.<br /><br />He just completed his debut solo album, Reflected, as well as his debut inspirational album, Road Less Traveled.<br /><br />Tickets for the Center Stage Performing Arts Series event are $6 for BYU-Idaho students and $12 for the general public. Tickets may be ordered by calling 496-2230 or online at www.byui.edu/tickets.<br /><br />]]></BodyCopy><xPower Type="Component" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent" /><xPower Type="Component" Name="News" label="News" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="x28" CompTypes="NewsNavigationComponent" /><xPower Type="List" Name="ContentSnippet" label="Content Snippet" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="" List=""><xPower Type="Component" Name="xPower" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="" /></xPower><xPower Type="Navigation" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false" Navigation="Ancestors" GenerationOrder="down" StartPage="x5" MaxNodes="" MaxDepth="" Query="" /><xPower Type="Component" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Component="x10257" CompTypes="SiteControl" /></NewsDetail>
