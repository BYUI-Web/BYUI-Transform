<p>The   technique of organizing all the course materials into folders labeled by day   is relatively common.&nbsp; Its strength is   that it isn't locked down to specific dates and so can be replicated   relatively easily between multiple sections of the same course or across   semesters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The   downside, of course, is that it isn't tied to specific dates and so students   have to keep track of where they are in the course of the semester.&nbsp; This method also doesn't lend itself as   well to activities that span multiple days or weeks.</p>

<p>The method   on the left is used in a course with an explicit weekly (instead of daily)   schedule.&nbsp; Blue and red colors and a   graphic representation communicate clearly to the student what work is to be   done in preparation for class and what to expect from each in-class   experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this   format makes the schedule absolutely clear, it doesn't lend itself as well to   organizing multiple files, activities or assessments under each day's   heading.</p>

<p>Organizing   by unit is a nice middle ground between the first two examples.&nbsp; Since units can be as long or short as   necessary, one gains the benefits of organization without being tied to   specific dates, while still providing a structure for dealing with multiple   assignments, instructions, assessments etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clarity   of the in-class and out-of-class distinction evident in example 2 is somewhat   lost with this method.</p>

<p>Another   means of organization that is popular with most students is to post a table   to the announcements page or another &lsquo;landing page' for the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Everything that the student needs is   hyperlinked from the table, so students needn't worry about trying to   understand the structure of all the files and folders used in the course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blog   tool from within I-Learn allows for the creation of tables with hyperlinks   that can then be cut and pasted as html code into the front page of the   website.</p>

<p>The instructor in this example chose to build a   table with hyperlinks like the instructor in the previous example, but to do so   using a .pdf editor rather than the blog tool from within Blackboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the document thus created isn't native to   Blackboard, it does provide a slick interface giving students almost   instanteneous access to any information and materials they select.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating this kind of hyperlinked .pdf document   requires being able to look up the static url's for each resource that is   stored within Blackboard.</p>

<p>Here is yet another example of a   table with hyperlinks which becomes the &lsquo;control central' for the   course.&nbsp; This example was created using   the text editing tools with the Blackboard interface.</p>

<p>This instructor has chosen to use   the Learning Model process steps as the framework for understanding how each   lesson within the course is organized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note the time estimates that have   been added to each folder in order to help the student better manage   study-time.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
