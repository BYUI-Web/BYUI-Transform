<h3>From Pathway Students<img height="265" src="Images/Admin_Offices/Online Learning/ONLNPathwayProspective/Photostack1.jpg" style="float: right;" width="291" /></h3>
<p>"When we use the learning model process and we teach one another, we can feel the Spirit with us and we have the opportunity to develop our skills and improve our speaking ."</p>
<p><br />"I feel very grateful and blessed for this program. I have learned a lot of things. My testimony is stronger and I know the Lord hears my prayers because he inspired our leaders to implement this program that is the answer of many prayers."</p>
<p><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f28g3s5YZKI&amp;feature=channel_video_title"><img alt="link to pathway video" height="236" src="Images/Admin_Offices/Online Learning/ONLNPathwayProspective/Photostack2.jpg" style="float: left; border: 18px solid white;" width="230" /></a>"So far my experience with the Pathway Program has been a wonderful blessing. The courses have helped me become a better communicator and critical thinker. It has allowed me to meet new people and hear many new perspectives."</p>
<p><br />"The program has been a blessing in my life. I am able to see more potential in myself. The way I think has improved, my spirituality has improved and my testimony has grown stronger. "</p>
<p><br />"The opportunities of being a lead student have helped me become a stronger leader. I've learned so much from my classes and my activities outside the classroom. It's a great opportunity to learn who you are and to prepare for the real world. I've done so many things I had never done before, such as improving my study skills. I have come to learn that preparing, teaching one another, pondering and proving really helps."</p>
<p><img alt="block quote" height="422" src="Images/Admin_Offices/Online Learning/ONLNPathwayProspective/photostackquote.jpg" style="float: right;" width="221" /><br />"The Pathway Program is a real blessing here in Ghana. When people hear about the program they express their eagerness to be part of it. I pray it spreads fast to other parts of Ghana, West Africa and eventually to bless the whole continent."</p>
<p><br />"The Pathway Program has strengthened my testimony in many different fields and has brought me a greater understanding of how I need to do the small things in my life. For the most part my faith cannot be changed unless I take further 'action', which is what the program has taught me I need to do. "</p>
<p><br />"Since becoming involved with the Pathway Program I have really come to see the need for a program like this and how it helps people to progress in life."</p>
<p><br />"I LOVE the Pathway Program, my classmates, instructors and the lessons! I feel like I have learned a great deal already. My friends and family members are inquiring more about it and I can't help but want to share this program with all of them. It is truly an inspired program from the Lord. I am thankful that BYU-Idaho was willing to give me a chance. It hasn't been easy to 'choose the right', but whenever I felt a challenge coming on, I thought of the Honor Code that I am to uphold. If I didn't have an additional standard to live up to, then I don't think I would be where I am today."</p>

<h3>From Institute Directors</h3>
<p>"There is a brightness of hope and appetite for learning. . . . There is an aggressiveness for learning that has never been here before."<br />- Chula Vista, CA Institute Director</p>
<p><img alt="photostrip" height="271" src="Images/Admin_Offices/Online Learning/ONLNPathwayProspective/photostack3.jpg" style="float: left; border: 20px solid white;" width="300" />"They are becoming active again in the Church, going on missions, marrying in the temple, and contributing in wonderful ways at home, at Church, and in the community-much more so than they were before starting Pathway, and much more so than they otherwise would."<br />-Nampa, ID Institute Director</p>
<p><br />"Many had been inactive and have shared things that lead me to believe that they are starting to make real changes in their life because of the spiritual direction they have gained through attending institute and doing the required scripture study on their own. . . . I am seeing lives change because of this program."&nbsp;- Riverside, CA Institute Director</p>
<p><br />"When the Pathway Program came to Pasco we were engaged in a process of trying to fund, on a Stake level, a few YSA's that would not have the chance, due to family circumstance, to get any college education. We were trying to raise $30,000 for just a few students to send them to BYUI and live and get some college. We were not serving very many at a great expense. Along came Pathway which was, in our circumstance, truly sent from heaven, and it accomplished, much more efficiently, what our Stake President had envisioned. We see first hand the hand of the Lord in the lives of the YSA." - Elder and Sister Mackay, Pasco, WA.</p>]]></IntroCopy><xPower Type="GroupStart" GroupStart="" Name="CellGroup" label="Cells" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="false"><numColumns type="enumeration" values="1 2 3 4 5" label="Select number of cell columns." readonly="false" hidden="false" required="true">3</numColumns><xPower Type="List" List="xpowercomponent_Cell" Name="CellList" label="Cell List" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="CellComponent" Expanded="false"><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="Cell" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="CellComponent" Expanded="false"/></xPower></xPower><xPower Type="List" List="xpowercomponent_BannerAd" Name="BannerAds" label="Rotating Ads (650x216px required)" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="BannerAdComponent" Expanded="false"><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="BannerAd" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="BannerAdComponent" Expanded="false"/></xPower><xPower Type="Navigation" StartPage="" MaxDepth="" MaxNodes="" GenerationOrder="down" Navigation="" Query="" Name="DeptEvents" label="Define Your Events Folder" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="x18360" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="GroupStart" GroupStart="" Name="QuickLinksGroup" label="Quick Links Group" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="false"><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="QuickLinks" label="Column 1" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="QuickLinksComponent"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="QuickLinks" label="Column 2" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="QuickLinksComponent"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="" Name="QuickLinks" label="Column 3" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="QuickLinksComponent"/></xPower><xPower Type="GroupStart" GroupStart="" Name="SEOGroup" label="SEO Group" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="false"><BrowserBarTitle type="string" label="Browser Bar Title" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false"></BrowserBarTitle><MetaDescription type="string" label="Meta Description" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false"></MetaDescription><NoFollow type="boolean" hidden="true" label="No Follow" readonly="false" required="false">false</NoFollow><NoIndex type="boolean" hidden="true" label="No Index" readonly="false" required="false">false</NoIndex><NoODP type="boolean" hidden="true" label="No ODP" readonly="false" required="false">false</NoODP><Priority type="enumeration" values="0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0" label="Priority" readonly="false" hidden="true" required="false">0.5</Priority></xPower><xPower Type="Navigation" StartPage="x5" MaxDepth="" MaxNodes="" GenerationOrder="down" Navigation="Ancestors" Query="" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false"/><xPower Type="Component" Component="x17147" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="false" required="false" CompTypes="SiteControl" Expanded="false"/></AdminPage>
