<p><br /> "The primary place to prepare disciple leaders is in the apartment," said Kevin Miyasaki, dean of students. "Therefore, the more we can develop gospel-standard living in the apartments, the better BYU-Idaho will be able to fulfill its mission."</p>
<p><br /> BYU-Idaho has been developing a program for teaching and encouraging raised living standards since Jan. 2008. The program, called Student Living, focuses on instating love, shared responsibility and respect in student apartments.</p>
<p><br /> "Our goal is to make each apartment a place where students don't just stop to sleep and eat," said Troy Dougherty, director of the new Housing and Student Living Office. "Each apartment should be a haven where students can thrive spiritually, socially, emotionally and academically."</p>
<p><br /> Dougherty said apartment managers play a critical role in establishing a proper culture in their apartment complex. They are more informed than anyone else of the comings and goings of students, he said. Therefore, Student Living utilizes apartment managers as a main avenue for emphasizing these principles. However, managers have historically turned to the Housing Office as their main connection to the university.</p>
<p><br /> "In the past, the Housing Office had trained apartment managers on administrative duties, then Student Living began training them too," Miyasaki said. "This merge brings the two offices together for a consistent and unified message."</p>
<p><br /> In order to deliver that message, BYU-Idaho has reorganized four new full-time positions: two education and standards managers, one business operations manager, and one owner and developer relations manager.</p>
<p><br /> "As personnel from the Housing and Student Living offices come together with a unified purpose and mission, we will be able to do more than we've ever done to help fulfill the university's mission," Dougherty said.</p>]]></BodyCopy><xPower Type="Component" Name="HighlightedLinks" label="Highlighted Links" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="HighlightedLinksComponent" /><xPower Type="Component" Name="News" label="News" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="x28" CompTypes="NewsNavigationComponent" /><xPower Type="List" Name="ContentSnippet" label="Content Snippet" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Expanded="" List=""><xPower Type="Component" Name="xPower" readonly="false" hidden="false" required="false" Component="" CompTypes="" /></xPower><xPower Type="Navigation" Name="AncestorNavigation" label="Ancestor Navigation" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Expanded="false" Navigation="Ancestors" GenerationOrder="down" StartPage="x5" MaxNodes="" MaxDepth="" Query="" /><xPower Type="Component" Name="SiteControl" label="Site Control" readonly="true" hidden="true" required="false" Component="x10257" CompTypes="SiteControl" /></NewsDetail>
