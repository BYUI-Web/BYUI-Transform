<li>When you graduate with your degree, <em>what specific skill will you have in your                                                             possession that an employer will pay you to do?</em> </li>
<li>If you want a job, don't forget the <em>employer's </em>point of view. </li>
<li>Every job has its positives <em>and</em> negatives. Try finding a job where you                                                             would feel comfortable. </li>
<li>Try out your  future career before you finish your degree by doing an internship                                                             or by  volunteering. This way you can find out if the job is what you thought  it                                                             would be. </li>
<li>The three main <em>screen out</em> criteria are:                                                                 
<ul>
<li>appearance,</li>
<li>dependability, and</li>
<li>skill.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting a  job has a lot to do with marketing - and you're the product. Make                                                             sure that  your materials look professional and that you act in a professional  manner. </li>
<li>Do your homework. </li>
<li>A positive first impression is very important. </li>
<li>When  conducting a job search, many people act like a gold mine - just waiting  to                                                             be  discovered. Most of the time, employers won't search you out. You need  to                                                             get out and  sell yourself. </li>
<li>Choose a major that you're excited about, yet has a practical application so                                                             you can find yourself a job upon completing your schooling. </li>
<li>If you need some help, just ask. Oftentimes, you don't "get" unless                                                             you " ask." </li>
<li>Networking is the easiest way to get a job. </li>
<li>Most jobs are never advertised. </li>
<li>Prepare for the interview. If you don't - it is painfully obvious to the employer.                                                             Be prepared for common questions. </li>
<li>Don't get too discouraged, searching for a job can be a real challenge, no matter                                                             how qualified you are. </li>
<li>Find out what education and experience is necessary to get the job that you want.                                                             Then, get to work preparing for that job. </li>
<li>At the present time, what job are you realistically prepared to get? Do you need                                                             more education or experience to get the job that you really want? </li>
<li>Generally speaking, the more education and training that you get, the more money                                                             you will make. </li>
<li>New jobs will require higher skills - especially computer skills. Technical skills                                                             are essential. </li>
<li>Employers want workers with:                                                                 
<ul>
<li>interpersonal skills,</li>
<li>leadership skills,</li>
<li>critical thinking skills,</li>
<li>decision making skills, and</li>
<li>writing and speaking skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to you nearest career resource center and ask for a list of the "hottest"                                                             jobs. </li>
<li>If you are  willing to relocate, you will have a much better chance of finding  employment.                                                             Some cities  are faster growing, more economically healthy, and have lower  unemployment                                                             rates. It is  generally easier to find a job in these cities. </li>
<li>Fill out applications completely and <em>very neatly.</em> </li>
<li>Doing a marginal job on your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is a good way to get you screened                                                             out of a job. </li>
<li>Proof-read <em>everything </em>that you send to an employer. </li>
<li>Ask people before you list them as references on your application or r&eacute;sum&eacute;. </li>
<li>An interview is "any contact that you have with someone that has authority                                                             to influence the decision as to whether or not you get hired." </li>
<li>Dress for success. </li>
<li>Sell yourself in the interview - yet, don't be too overbearing. Remember, the                                                             employer is trying to find someone that he/she can work with. </li>
<li>Be courageous and confident. Look people in the eyes. </li>
<li>Know your own skills and qualities.</li>
