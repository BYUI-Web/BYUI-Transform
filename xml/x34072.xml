Trip Leaders lead the activities and get outdoors.</p>
<p>Volunteers make up the largest group of students that help run Activities. Being a volunteer is a great way to jump in and get involved, develop skills, meet people and help create existing events and programs at BYU-Idaho. Volunteers work under the direction of managers who oversee the planning, organization and execution of specific events and programs.</p>
<p>Outdoor trips include everything from Geocaching to Whitewater Rafting to Tin Can Backpacker Stove Construction. Event details can be found on the Outdoor Activities main page and listing of available trips to lead are listed in the student leader application itself.</p>]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
