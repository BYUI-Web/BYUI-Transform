<div class="answers" id="box1" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">If you do not have any add/drop boxes, this usually means one of the following:</p>
<ol class="answer">
<li>You have a hold on your account that prevents registration (adding/dropping) until you resolve the hold;</li>
<li>You do not have registration clearance, and you need to call the Student Records and Registration Office to obtain clearance; or</li>
<li>You are not currently admitted to BYU&ndash;Idaho.</li>
</ol></div>

<div class="answers" id="box2" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Your son or daughter can designate you to register for classes for them, as long as they release their username and password to you so you can access the registration website.</p>

<h2 class="header">Adding Classes / Instructor Authorizations</h2>
<div class="qna" style="display: none;">
<h3><a class="question" href="#box5" rel="ibox" title="I want to add a specific class, but it&rsquo;s full. What do I do?">I want to add a specific class, but it&rsquo;s full. What do I do?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box5" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">If students want to add a class that is full, they need to either keep checking back for openings, or they can contact the course instructor. The instructor may, at his/her discretion, grant a Capacity Authorization to the student to add the full class or some instructors have waiting lists.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box6" rel="ibox" title="I want to add a specific class, but I have not taken its prerequisite(s). Can I still take the class?">I want to add a specific class, but I have not taken its prerequisite(s). Can I still take the class?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box6" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">If students want to add a class, but they haven&rsquo;t met the prerequisite(s), they may contact the instructor and request a Course Requisite Authorization; however, it is the instructor&rsquo;s decision whether he/she will (or can) allow students to add certain classes without having taken the prerequisite(s).</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box7" rel="ibox" title="I want to add a specific class, but it overlaps with another class I&rsquo;m already registered for (e.g., there is a 15-minute time conflict). Can I still take the class?">I want to add a specific class, but it overlaps with another class I&rsquo;m already registered for (e.g., there is a 15-minute time conflict). Can I still take the class?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box7" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">If students want to add a class, but it conflicts with another one of their classes, they may contact the course instructor for the class they want to add and request a Schedule Conflict Authorization; however, it is the instructor&rsquo;s decision whether he/she will allow students to add their class and accommodate time conflicts.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box8" rel="ibox" title="I want to add a specific class, but I do not meet the requirements (e.g., 2.5 GPA, junior standing, instructor authorization required, etc.). Can I still take the class?">I want to add a specific class, but I do not meet the requirements (e.g., 2.5 GPA, junior standing, instructor authorization required, etc.). Can I still take the class?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box8" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">If students want to add a class, but they haven&rsquo;t met the requirement(s), they may contact the instructor and request a Course Requirement Authorization; however, it is the instructor&rsquo;s decision whether he/she will (or can) allow students to add certain classes without having met the requirement(s).</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box9" rel="ibox" title="The instructor has authorized me to add a class, but I still can&rsquo;t add it. What do I do?">The instructor has authorized me to add a class, but I still can&rsquo;t add it. What do I do?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box9" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">There are many reasons that could keep a course authorization from working. Such reasons include the following: 1) You are trying to add a different section from what the instructor has authorized you to add; 2) You have only been authorized for the Capacity Authorization when in fact you may also need a Course Requirement Authorization or other authorization to be able to add that section; 3) You are not able to add the class because you are an off-track student trying to add a DAY section or vice-versa; 4) There is a hold on your account preventing you from registering (adding/dropping) classes.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box10" rel="ibox" title="I&rsquo;ve contacted the instructor about an authorization, but it&rsquo;s been several days, and I&rsquo;ve received no response. What do I do?">I&rsquo;ve contacted the instructor about an authorization, but it&rsquo;s been several days, and I&rsquo;ve received no response. What do I do?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box10" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">A follow-up phone call or e-mail sometimes helps you get in touch with an instructor. If after several attempts you still cannot reach him/her, you may contact the department secretary for that instructor&rsquo;s department to see if she can assist you in contacting the instructor.8</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box11" rel="ibox" title="I can&rsquo;t find a specific class that I want to add. What do I do?">I can&rsquo;t find a specific class that I want to add. What do I do?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box11" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Make sure you have cleared all of your search criteria and conducted more general searches (e.g., if you&rsquo;re specifically looking for a math class, simply search under the Mathematics discipline; don&rsquo;t search for anything more specific than that). If you still cannot find it, it&rsquo;s possible that the specific course you&rsquo;re looking for is not available this semester or has been discontinued. You may contact the Student Records and Registration Office for assistance.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box12" rel="ibox" title="I&rsquo;m trying to add a class, but there are no add boxes next to the classes. What&rsquo;s wrong?">I&rsquo;m trying to add a class, but there are no add boxes next to the classes. What&rsquo;s wrong?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box12" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">If you do not have any add boxes, this usually means one of the following: 1) You have a hold on your account that prevents registration (adding/dropping) until you resolve the hold; 2) You do not have registration clearance, and you need to call the Student Records and Registration Office to obtain clearance; or 3) You are not currently admitted to BYU&ndash;Idaho.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box13" rel="ibox" title="Can I add a class if I have a hold on my account?">Can I add a class if I have a hold on my account?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box13" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">No. Most holds prevent students from registering (adding/dropping classes) until they resolve the hold. Keep in mind, however, that the following holds do not prohibit registration: Academic Warning (WARN), Academic Probation (PROB), Achieving Academic Success Workshop (AASW), No School Address (NOLO), Academic Advising Plan (PLAN), Endorsement Notification (SHWA), and Invalid U.S. SSN (SSN) holds.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box14" rel="ibox" title="Can I add a class after the add deadline?">Can I add a class after the add deadline?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box14" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Yes, as long as you have received at least a Course Requirement Authorization, in addition to any other authorizations you may need, from the instructor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="header">General Registration</h2>
<div class="qna" style="display: none;">
<h3><a class="question" href="#box15" rel="ibox" title="How do I know when I can register?">How do I know when I can register?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box15" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Student registration for classes is by priority according to credit level. Credits earned plus currently enrolled BYU&ndash;Idaho credits are calculated into the priority registration credit count.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box16" rel="ibox" title="What if I miss my designated registration time?">What if I miss my designated registration time?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box16" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">If a student misses their designated registration time, they may still register for classes but risk less availability of class selection. Students can add classes to their schedules through the first week of the semester.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box17" rel="ibox" title="How do I know how many credits I have?">How do I know how many credits I have?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box17" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Students can log into my.byui.edu, click the Student tab, and on the left side of the page, click the gray Unofficial Transcript tab to pull up their academic history. This will indicate how many credits a student has earned, then the student can add their currently enrolled BYU&ndash;Idaho credits (if any) to this total to determine how many credits they have to determine their priority registration date.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box18" rel="ibox" title="Do my currently enrolled BYU&ndash;Idaho credits count towards my priority registration date?">Do my currently enrolled BYU&ndash;Idaho credits count towards my priority registration date?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box18" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Yes.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box19" rel="ibox" title="Do my transfer credits count towards my priority registration date?">Do my transfer credits count towards my priority registration date?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box19" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Yes, as long as your transfer credits are recorded on your BYU&ndash;Idaho transcript. Transfer courses must be completed (with final grades) and recorded on your BYU&ndash; Idaho transcript for them to calculate into your priority registration date. Transfer credits that you are currently enrolled in cannot be calculated into this date.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box20" rel="ibox" title="Why do freshmen register last?">Why do freshmen register last?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box20" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Student registration for classes is by priority according to credit level. Seniors, juniors, and sophomores have increasingly fewer class options as they advance in their academic careers, thereby necessitating their need to register earlier and have top pick of the classes they need in order to graduate. Freshmen have a wide range of options between all of the Foundations courses and major courses they still need to take, so they register after everyone else for this reason.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box21" rel="ibox" title="Can I register for classes if I&rsquo;m on Academic Warning?">Can I register for classes if I&rsquo;m on Academic Warning?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box21" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Yes, you may register for classes while on Academic Warning. Please visit this website for more information: <a class="underline" href="../academic-standards">http://www.byui.edu/registrarsoffice/Academic-Standards</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box22" rel="ibox" title="Can I register for classes if I&rsquo;m on Academic Probation?">Can I register for classes if I&rsquo;m on Academic Probation?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box22" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Yes, but you may only register for up to 12 credits. Please visit this website for more information: <a href="../academic-standards">http://www.byui.edu/registrarsoffice/Academic-Standards.</a></p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box23" rel="ibox" title="Can I register for classes if I&rsquo;m on Academic Suspension?">Can I register for classes if I&rsquo;m on Academic Suspension?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box23" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">No. You must fulfill the terms of your suspension before you will be eligible to register for any classes (including night and online classes) at BYU&ndash;Idaho. Please visit this website for more information: <a href="../academic-standards">http://www.byui.edu/registrarsoffice/Academic-Standards</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box24" rel="ibox" title="Can I register for classes if I am no longer admitted?">Can I register for classes if I am no longer admitted?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box24" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">No. You must be admitted as a type of student (e.g., Day, Part-time, Continuing Education, etc.) to be able to register for any academic classes offered at BYU&ndash;Idaho.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box25" rel="ibox" title="How many credits can I register for?">How many credits can I register for?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box25" style="display: none;">
<ul class="answer">
<li>12 credits are required to be considered a full-time student</li>
<li>14 credits are required to be eligible for university scholarship</li>
<li>15 credits are required to graduate in eight semesters or four years and for the Fast Grad program.</li>
<li>21 credit hours is the maximum a student can take.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box26" rel="ibox" title="Do I have to take at least 12 credits?">Do I have to take at least 12 credits?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box26" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">No, students do not have to take at least 12 credits. To remain admitted to BYU&ndash; Idaho, students must take a least one class during their on-track semesters. To be considered a full-time student, however, students must be registered for at least 12 credit hours per semester.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box27" rel="ibox" title="Can I take more than 21 credits during a single semester (or more than 10.0 credits during a block/term)?">Can I take more than 21 credits during a single semester (or more than 10.0 credits during a block/term)?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box27" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Twenty-one credit hours is the recommended maximum. Students must obtain permission from the Student Records and Registration Office to take more than 21 credits per semester or 10 credits per block/term. Students must demonstrate a successful academic history to qualify (e.g., a cumulative 3.0 GPA or higher, a history of high course loads in 2+ consecutive semesters, etc.).</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box28" rel="ibox" title="What if I can only take a few classes? How many credits do I need to keep my admission status?">What if I can only take a few classes? How many credits do I need to keep my admission status?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box28" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">On-track students need to take at least one class (or at least 0.5 credits) to maintain their admission status. Half credits are charged the same as one full credit.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box29" rel="ibox" title="I think I may want to audit one of my classes. What does auditing a class mean?">I think I may want to audit one of my classes. What does auditing a class mean?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box29" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Students who audit a class are not responsible for attendance, daily preparations or examinations, and no grade is reported or recorded on the permanent record. Tuition for audit classes is assessed on the same basis as for credit classes. An &ldquo;I&rdquo; grade may not be made up by repeating the class as an audit. Departments have the right to refuse to allow students to audit individual courses. Registered students who drop all credit classes and only have audit classes remaining are considered withdrawn from the University effective the latest drop 5 date of the non-audit classes. Students will need to re-apply through the Admissions Office for the next semester. Compliance with deadlines is required, unless a deferment is obtained.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box30" rel="ibox" title="How do I change my enrollment in a class to audit?">How do I change my enrollment in a class to audit?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box30" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Students must first register for the class for credit and then contact the Student Records and Registration Office by emailing, registration@byui.edu, to change the course to audit. Students may not change class status from credit to audit or from audit to credit after the deadline to withdraw from a class without earning a &ldquo;W.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box31" rel="ibox" title="I&rsquo;m in a variable credit class and need to change how many credits I&rsquo;m enrolled in. How do I do that?">I&rsquo;m in a variable credit class and need to change how many credits I&rsquo;m enrolled in. How do I do that?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box31" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Students may contact the Student Records and Registration Office for assistance with changing their credit amount in a variable credit class. Please note that students may increase the amount of credits they are enrolled in at any time in the semester; however, students may only decrease the amount of credits they&rsquo;re enrolled in as long as the decrease request is before the deadline to withdraw from a class without earning a &ldquo;W.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box32" rel="ibox" title="I need to switch from one section to another (e.g., from FDENG 101-02 to FDENG 101-03). How do I do that?">I need to switch from one section to another (e.g., from FDENG 101-02 to FDENG 101-03). How do I do that?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box32" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">If a student is switching from one section to another before the deadline to withdraw from a class without earning a &ldquo;W,&rdquo; all they need to do is drop the section they&rsquo;re in and then add the section they want. They may need an instructor authorization to be able to add the section they want. If a student is switching from one section to another after the deadline to withdraw from a class without earning a &ldquo;W,&rdquo; the instructor of the class they want to add needs to contact the Student Records and Registration Office for assistance so the student does not receive an inaccurate W grade for the section they drop. NOTE: This only applies to students switching from one section to another of the same course. This does not apply to students who are switching into a different course (e.g., switching from a lower level class to a higher level class, or vice versa). If switching from a different course, the W grade will be applied to the class dropped if it is after the deadline to withdraw from a class without earning a W.</p>
</div>
<h3><a class="question" href="#box33" rel="ibox" title="I&rsquo;m enrolled in one religion class, but I&rsquo;d like to add a second one. When can I do so?">I&rsquo;m enrolled in one religion class, but I&rsquo;d like to add a second one. When can I do so?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box33" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Students who wish to take two religion classes in a given term may attempt to do so after the first day of the class (or block) if there is available seating and they have obtained clearance to do so from the Religion Department Chairman. Students can then add the course to their schedules, or, if necessary, meet with the instructor of that class to receive any needed authorization(s). Students who wish to take more than two religion classes in a given term must obtain clearance from the Religion Department Chairman. The Chairman then contacts the Student Records and Registration Office to register the student for the class.6</p>

<h3><a class="question" href="#box35" rel="ibox" title="Can I get an excused absence for University activities, sickness, or other personal emergencies?">Can I get an excused absence for University activities, sickness, or other personal emergencies?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box35" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Students are responsible for class attendance. No absences, whether approved by the University for participation in University-sponsored activities or necessitated by sickness or other personal emergencies, are &ldquo;excused&rdquo; in the sense that the student is relieved from class work assigned during the absence. To ensure continuity, students must make up missed work. In most cases, repeated absences will result in a lower grade or failure.</p>

What is a W grade and how does it affect my transcript?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box37" style="display: none;">
<ul class="answer">
<li>W grades are placed on your academic record (transcript) if you drop a class anytime after the 22 nd day in a semester (or after the 15 th day in a block/term) up until the final drop deadline, for any reason.</li>
<li>W grades are NOT calculated into your grade point average (GPA).</li>
<li>W grades remain on your transcript even if you retake the class at a later date.</li>
<li>W grades are considered non-progress grades and are calculated into the 75% progress requirement.</li>
<li>If you are receiving Federal Financial Aid, you must check with that office to determine how W grades affect your eligibility.</li>

What can I do to keep my admission status so I don&rsquo;t have to re-apply?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box42" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">We encourage students to do everything they can to arrange their schedules in such a way that they are able to attend their on-track semesters as full-time students. Taking a single class during your on-track semester to &ldquo;hold your spot&rdquo; is discouraged, because it extends the amount of time it will take for you to graduate, and it prevents other students from attending BYU&ndash;Idaho because you&rsquo;re taking up a spot that may have otherwise been used by a student who takes advantage of their time here. We realize that students encounter extenuating circumstances that prevent them from taking classes during one of their on-track semesters, and in those situations, students may request a semester deferment from the Admissions Office: <a class="underline" href="../admissions/current-students/deferments-time-off">http://www.byui.edu/admissions/current-students/deferments-time-off</a></p>

<p class="answer">Yes, off-track students can take CTED (Continuing Education or night) and ONLN (online) classes during their off-track. Off-track students can take up to 21.0 credits of CTED and ONLN classes, if they wish.</p>

<div class="answers" id="box44" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">Student registration for classes is by priority according to credit level, no matter whether you&rsquo;re on-track or off-track. Credits earned plus currently enrolled BYU&ndash;Idaho credits are calculated into the priority registration credit count.</p>

Is there any way I can take the DAY section as an off-track student?</a></h3>
<div class="answers" id="box45" style="display: none;">
<p class="answer">If you are off-track and have completed 60 credits and at least 6 BYU-I credits, you can register for 300-400 level DAY as well as CTED and ONLN sections starting 24 business hours before the semester starts. If you have not met those requirements then off-track students CANNOT take DAY sections. The only other way off-track students can take DAY classes is if they get on Fast Grad or if they receive some other track override from the Admissions Office. If off-track students get placed on Fast Grad or receive a track override, then they are eligible to take only DAY or ONLN classes, not CTED classes.</p>
