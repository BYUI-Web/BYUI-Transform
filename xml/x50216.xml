In order to complete the applied associate's degree or certificate, a student needs to complete at least 15 credits in residence at any of the Church Educational System schools: BYU, BYU-Idaho, BYU-Hawaii, or LDS Business College.&nbsp; If you have ever completed coursework at any of these schools, it can be applied to the 15-credit residency requirement.&nbsp; This requirement is also satisfied for those who have completed Academic Start in BYU-Idaho's Pathway Program.&nbsp; If you are interested in taking courses without completing the applied associate's degree, you do not need to complete any credits in residence.<br /><br /></p>]]></BodyCopy></HiddenText>
